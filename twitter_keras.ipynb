and outdated the gift directed by sam raimi is tried and true effort that surprises very little and includes everything from wide array of suspects and red herrings to mansions in the deep south with moss trees out front to the eventual discovery of waterlogged corpse found in nearby pond nit fairly obvious who the killer is in fact predicted who it would be before the movie began and was correct in my preliminary suspicions nthe film ultimately shouldn work but it does thanks to sparkling cast that fills each character with so many memorable nuances the most fun to be had is in simply watching the people interact with each other nannie wilson cate blanchett is recently widowed mother of three sons who makes her living giving psychic readings to the residents of her backwater southern hometown nsome of her mainstay clients include valerie barksdale hilary swank who is severely abused by her husband donnie keanu reeves and buddy cole giovanni ribisi an unstable mechanic who is confused by the nightmares he been having about mysterious blue diamond that is somehow linked to his father nfor annie she does not give the readings merely for money but uses it as way of seeking solace in finding the good in everyone future nher late grandmother rosemary harris told her as child that it was gift she was given and she should always remember that nwhen annie eldest son is involved in fight at school she meets the nice guy school principal wayne collins greg kinnear whom she finds herself attracted to nbut wayne is engaged to the wealthy jessica king katie holmes whom annie immediately gets negative vibe about nat party with her best friend linda kim dickens annie stumbles upon jessica in compromising position with lawyer david duncan gary cole nsoon after jessica has disappeared leaving everyone in frenzy over what could have possibly happened to her and annie starts to have nightmares and apparitions linking jessica with the vicious redneck donnie barksdale and the pond behind his home the gift may be cliched on sheer storytelling level but the performances and tight direction from raimi who has redeemed himself for his embarrassing last film 1999 for love of the game lift the picture up several notches nslowly enveloping the viewer into the many intriguing characters and their individual plights the disappearance of jessica at the 30 minute mark divulges the movie true intentions and transforms the proceedings into taut at times frightening horror mystery nat the center of the film is the exceptional cate blanchett 1999 the talented mr ripley who turns annie wilson from what could have been little more than run of the mill protagonist into very exact down to earth realistic person with valid troubles and caring attitude towards those around her nblanchett takes the unextraordinary material and runs with it giving the entire film truly classy aura that it otherwise might not have had nwe follow her at every turn because she is so mesmerizing both as character and an actress nblanchett isn the only bright performer as she is ably supported by one of the best casts of the year nin her first role following her oscar win for 1999

been the best this is the biggest compliment he could possibly get and it is also one of the better performances he has given ngiovanni ribisi 2000 the boiler room is heartbreaking as mentally slow

frankenstein nsince was unfamiliar of whale prior to viewing the film there is no way to know how accurate the film is but suspect that much of it only came from whale inner fantasies and hallucinations nwhale who fought in wwi and then went on to become known for his work on horror pictures decided fifteen years before his death at age 67 to quit filmmaking once homosexual scandal broke out involving him nas the film tells it during the end of his life whale at his large home in a became infatuated with the tall handsome and much younger man clayton boone brendan fraser who was working as the gardener at his home njames whale we learn quickly was what many people refer to him as in the film dirty old man nin one of the opening scenes young film enthusiast visits whale home to interview him and whale agrees on one condition for every question he answers the young man must take off an article of clothing nbecause of this episode we know exactly what it is whale wants when he asks clayton to pose for him for painting later making the excuse that his bright white shirt is disracting only so he will take it off nclayon agrees and doesn really think much of this much to the warnings of his friends becoming more and more intrigued in the stories whale tells him about his past ncertainly the relationship between whale and boone is headed for downfall since whale starts to grow deep love for this young man even though boone is not gay and whale himself realizes he is nearing the conclusion to his life as he begins to seldom suffer mild strokes and moments of true catharsis gods and monsters is an intimate and seemingly respectful portrait of director who was forced to become somewhat of an outcast due to his sexual preference and never got the recognition he would have liked since he longed to be referred to as motion picture director rather than horror director nand in one heartbreaking scene he attends party with boone being his guest held by director george cuckor and finds that many of the other attendees do not recognize him anymore nit is evident that whale first love in his life was making movies and when his career ultimately fell apart so did his passion in life nas played brilliantly by ian mckellen james whale comes off as sad but dignified man and person who was not afraid to stand out from others just as long as he knew he was being true to himself nhe never hid the fact that he was gay however even if it meant threatening his filmmaking profession and it was this unblinking honesty that made him great person nthrough the complicated relationship that develops between whale and boone boone of course only things of whale as possible friend or someone he can talk to while it means so much more to whale who sees boone as sort of his salvation in life nalthough boone is only in dead end job as gardener of people homes whale views him as the ideal man not only one that is good looking even though it is this attraction that first begins his feelings but one that will actually listen to him nsince whale lives with only his loyal but disapproving maid touchingly portrayed by lynn redgrave it is boone that whale can talk to in his ultimate reclusion from the world and the only reason whale finally decides to attend the gathering of george cuckor nalthough an extremely fine and mature picture few small elements hold the film back from ultimate greatness nit is appreciated that the film does not pull for any obvious or overly dramatic story developments but it is little thin and the structuring of the on again off again friendship at the film center is fairly predictable nwe know early on where these two characters are headed and we can guess that there will be final confrontation between the two as the tension slowly builds nin lesser hands this set up might have felt too calculated but it is not in the surprisingly deft treatment and writing that helps the film to be much more than this nalso subplot is briefly brought up between clayton and waitress working at bar effectively played by lolita davidovich but abruptly dropped and never brought up again nif the film was not going to follow up on this side story then it perhaps should have been taken out altogether gods and monsters is heartfelt and intelligent motion picture impressively directed by bill condon who sense relates to or fully understands the meaning behind the curious relationship between whale and boone nthe film also plays as tribute to fine man who met an untimely end nwalking away from gods and monsters it was ian mckellen marvelous and astounding performance that left the most impression on me and doubt there could have been anyone who could have stepped into the role more fully and believably nit is sad

screen go back and watch any scene with jar jar binks in the phantom menace because this movie is not scary or even remotely creepy nmy colleague and friend chuck dowling wrote that if less is more then the blair witch filmmakers must have thought that nothing is more nand this worked for him nwell m sorry but nothing nis nothing nnothing is not more nit nothiiiiiinggggggggggg ni do not pay 5 dollars to see nothing nothing is free available all around the world at location near you ni am absolutely in amazement that some people find this movie scary ni could just discount them and say well guess they are just pansy chicken shits who are probably scared of their own shadow nbut have intelligent friends who like this movie and so that doesn hold water nthere must be some other reason then again maybe my first thought is correct think ll try pointing their shadow out to them one day and test their reaction nwhen hear people praising this film never hear them talking about what makes up about 97 of this movie three kids bickering with each other about being lost nthey only talk about what might make up possibly 3 to 4 minutes of screen time nthis being few very short night scenes where the kids hear some unscary sounds and another where they shout josh nover and over nthis film should not be called the blair witch project it should more accurately be called three dumb and pisspoor filmmakers get lost nand argue with each other noh ladies and gentlemen you will be so scared when you hear them shouting josh nand if you thought that was scary wait till you see pile of rocks and then some tinkertoy lincoln logs oh my dear lord you will be pissing in your pants with fear noh yeah and some goo on one of their backpacks nyou ve never seen terror like this folks and you don want to nthe chevy chase goldie hawn comedy foul play is creepier than this film for current films highly recommend the sixth sense or stir of echoes for creepy filmgoing experience nthis film is an example of marketing with no substance nthe marketing was brilliant and the whole nation is in awe of just the premise for the film nthey want this film to be good nand think they are reaching and praising the wrong movie because they don have anything else to praise nthat wonderful film that rejuvenates the horror genre may come along but this is not it nthis film could have been so much better njust think if maybe there had been only 10 minutes of arguing about being lost and 80 minutes of nighttime stuff ni saw this movie with girl who was extremely pumped for it nshe was sold on this film nand then at one point during it she turned to me and asked are nwe supposed to be scared by this ni ve heard one opinion that you have to use your imagination to create the fear in this movie nwell thought that was what the filmmakers were supposed to do nuse their imagination and create good movie ni mean anyone can use their imagination and not pay 5 bucks for it nbut even if you like this idea then what are you imagining nan entity called the blair witch nsome rednecks fucking with these kids nare either of these things really scary when you think about it ni ve heard several people say that this movie makes them recall how scary it can be to be out in the woods and hear something nwell sure thats scary in real life but there are lot of things that are scary in real life that are not scary in movie nor even interesting nyou could sit in your house and see snake or spider and it could be scary but in film it wouldn be nand no movie does not need big budget or cgi special effects to be scary or creepy nactually the less the better see the equally awful remake of the haunting nbut you have to do something nyou cant just count on us all having nostalgic memories of how something like this could be scary if it were real nand by the way about the shakycam filming in blair witch naren these supposed to be filmmakers who should know how to point camera and shoot something without shaking the camera constantly ni not even talking about the couple scenes where they are terrified that justified ni talking about the other 87 minutes of the movie where they can seem to shoot anything smoothly at all nminor quibble there nthere is feeling in me that the people that like this movie are suckers nthat the filmmakers are just laughing their asses off all the way to the bank nand think there is good chance they will see this film again and say to themselves what was thinking nbut if they don then thats fine nif it works for them then that okay guess ni just lament that by making this movie hit we are going to be subjected to more of the nothing is more approach npretty soon we re going to get some movies like this just still shot of prison jail cell nfor 90 minutes nand we ll have to use our imagination and think to ourselves my god wouldn it be scary to spend life in prison nthis movie is the scariest movie of all time nor shot of coffin with some

doofy ways but there are couple of other things that set this one negatively apart nfirst off why did they leave off the national lampoon heading on the title ni couldn find any reasons why but maybe the fact is even national lampoon didn want to be associated with such lame film nthat saying lot especially when you look at what else the company has proudly presented loaded weapon 1 pcu etc if they expected this to be another hit you would assume they be proud to tack on the notorious header but for reasons only we can guess at like the movie sucking they didn nthere is another difference here that makes an obvious impact nthe first three films in the vacation series were written by john hughes talented writer who is behind several popular films of the 80 including mr nmom sixteen candles the breakfast club weird science pretty in pink ferris bueller day off planes trains and automobiles and uncle buck nwowzers nwhat r sum nlooking at the names you think this guy wrote everything that now stands as movie icon for the 1980 nwell that not all nthis guy also brought us 90 hits including the home alone series the remake of 101 dalmatians dennis the menace and the current flubber nvegas vacation however didn have john hughes behind it and the loss is very obvious nthis time around the script is in the hands of elisa bell whose only credits thus far include four made for tv movies nvegas vacation plays very much like one and it would actually work much better as made for tv sequel nif this sounds like wild idea it not nrevenge of the nerds third and fourth installments were both television movies and they seemed like it nvegas vacation would fit in well on the fox network as 2 00 m nsunday morning movie but as silver screen major motion picture it quite out of place nstephen kessler jejune direction doesn help things either nhe only makes the film even more tv movie ish neach consecutive vacation movie has suffered drop in directing power nwe started the series off with harold ramis who also directed caddyshack and groundhog day as well as co writing ghostbusters nnot too bad nthen we had national lampoon european vacation being directed by amy heckerling who would go on to direct the hits look who talking and clueless as well as having already directed the infamous fast times at ridgemont high nlastly we had national lampoon christmas vacation directed by jeremiah chechik who went on to direct the charming benny joon nkessler so far has one title under his belt the short film birch street gym which received an oscar nomination in 1992 ngranted that this was his first attempt at feature length film we can allow for some amateurish quality but instead we get movie straight from the text book boring bland and deeply unoriginal nif you loved the vacation movies and know some of us did there still isn anything here worth seeing nif you loved them don ruin your good impressions of the series by indulging in this tragic example of cinema ala carte nif you never did like the series why the need to confirm why ',\n",

              " 'on re watching italian writer director dario argento much lauded murder mystery tenebrae was struck more than anything else by how many sins he commits as storyteller and manages to get away with nin emphasising style over matters of plot argento is somewhat notorious in cult film circles but some aficionados still praise tenebrae as the greatest of his giallo murder mysteries nwhile it certainly not perfect repeated viewings reveal it to be nonetheless densely plotted and terrifically stylish thriller nthe story follows promotional visit to rome by famous american mystery novelist peter neal anthony franciosa where he discovers that serial killer is on the loose inspired by his latest book tenebrae nwith the police on his back for leads he decides to take personal interest in the case and he soon becomes drawn into mystery where all is not as it seems nthe film benefits enormously from fine central performance by franciosa nhe brings grace charm and deceptive benigness to his character which provides an interesting foil to both the violence of the books he writes and the unfolding real life horror around him nthe film is awash with fascinating psychosexual tension nargento peels back the facade of showbiz and jetset lifestyles to reveal an amoral ambivalent shadowy world where desire in all its forms has become dangerous business ntenebrae is perhaps the most multi layered of argento scripts to date and there is much bubbling underneath the surface here nit may take at least two or three viewings to appreciate all the psychological themes at play nin that respect it strongly recalls his previous giallo deep red profondo rosso the full length italian language version and fans will enjoy spotting the recurring themes nneedless to say for argento fans there is no denying the director brilliance as stylist nmany of the action and murder sequences are directed with his characteristic finesse and feature plenty of intriguing camerawork nthey are all the more impressive for the fact that in this film argento creates mood by filling his scenes with light rather than the dark shadows and deep rich colours of earlier works like deep red and suspiria ninstead tenebrae set design and lighting paints sleek clinical chilly vision of vaguely futuristic urban world nand the soundtrack mix of electronic atmospheres and gothic rock by frequent argento collaborators goblin is the perfect accompaniment nso tenebrae has much to recommend it no question nstill constantly nagging at the back of this viewers mind is several lumps in the narrative nsome critics argue that logic doesn matter in argento films but damnit it matters in all films to the point where viewers don deserve to feel cheated nby the way if you don want to know the solution to the mystery then skip the next three paragraphs nabout an hour into tenebrae the story takes an unexpected twist which properly handled could have proved ingenious nwe witness the murder of the serial killer himself by man who we later discover is none other than the author peter neal nhe is insane apparently nthe murders then continue for the remainder of the film as neal decides it time to settle some personal business involving his neurotic wife nhe is finally revealed to us as this second killer in the film bloody climax nbut argento muffs the twist both technically and narratively nyou see we are supposed to be tricked into thinking that during this scene peter neal is actually an innocent witness who was crouching in the bushes nearby the whole time and spying on the killer house nbut thanks to poor editing its had to believe neal could have murdered the killer anyway nbad cutting puts the timing way out nin other words he almost in two places at once nduring this crucial scene we are also thrown ridiculous red herring nby the film end you realise that for the sake of an alibi neal must have self inflicted nasty injury in this earlier scene to make it look like he was attacked by fleeing assailant nthe injury nhe banged himself on the head with bloody great rock nthus the revelation of the hero as killer and anti hero in the final scenes may still prove shocking but its all somewhat implausible by the time the end credits have rolled nhelpfully in the end we do learn that the bizarre flashbacks of personal humiliation and murder that have permeated the film belonged to neal all along nbut there too is problem as the explanations offered for his motivations are psychologically fuzzy to say the least nthe story owes us better understanding of franciosa mind his concealed madness and his sudden murderous rampage ntenebrae is also marred by annoying little inconsistencies nfor instance teenage boy and girl leave hotel room and minutes later we see the girl riding off on the back of motorbike nwe would assume the rider is the same boy but it turns out to be some male character we aren even introduced too nthat careless filmmaking pure and simple nwhy you may ask do go on about the story flaws nbecause when it comes to visuals and set pieces argento is one of the most exciting filmmakers in the world ntake one of the extended scenes in tenebrae nan upset girl wandering the streets at night needlessly taunts guard dog to the point where almost unbelievably it jumps high fence and chases her across town nfinally as she desperately seeks escape from this crazed canine she accidentally stumbles on the serial killer lair nit an absolutely masterful sequence tense and exciting and communicating wealth of information through visuals alone nand that exactly the kind of thing that makes the flaws so frustrating ntoo often it seems argento films as whole are less than the sum of their impressive parts nmind you if you love murder mysteries then tenebrae is still worth look nand if you re fan of argento unique style of giallo thriller then it essential nsee the uncut widescreen version if you can and drink in some of the wonderful cinematography by luciano tovoli nit a stylish great looking and quirky film despite the problem narrative na shame because it doesn have to be that way ntake argento more recent stendhal syndrome 1992 where with the aid of co writer franco ferrini he fashioned solid storyline without sacrificing any of his surreal weirdness or visual panache nproof that he can do it if he tries

performance as he did in that one he had just won an oscar carlito way was destined for underrated heaven nthat what it is an underrated gem of movie nand what shame because pacino and de palma both do amazing jobs with it and turn it into great piece of pulpy character study carlito way deals with well carlito brigante pacino puerto rican ex drug kingpin who gets out of long jailterm when his coke addicted curly haired lawyer sean penn points out legal technicality nof course carlito was actually awoken in prison and has decided to go straight even if he really crook at heart ncarlito like barry lyndon is man who is trapped by fate at every turn and can escape into something he is not ncarlito attempts at clean legal life are thwarted at nearly every turn nwhen he first gets out friend of his ends up leading him into big shoot out where he has to kill couple people to survive nhe constantly getting bugged by the government to see if he doing anything illegal and his lawyer finds himself neck deep in pile of shit needing him to try and help him out which includes him doing some prison breaking ncarlito like ratso rizzo wants to go to miami since according to film logic that where it at but needs some funding nbeing legend he is quickly able to get nice job running big dance club this is the 70s by the way and since some of this takes place in night clubs we get to hear all sorts of 70s classics including several c nand the sunshine band tunes my personal favorite nhe gets bodyguard the great luis guzman at his best and is soon running pretty good business even if he constantly attracting underworld young thugs like benny blanco from the bronx john leguiziamo who is more than once pointed out to be young version of carlito non the other side the symbol of promise and hope is gail penelope ann miller what happened to her his girlfriend from before prison nshe a goregeous ballerina and stripper and soon carlito is trying to get back with her and take her with him when he finally leaves for miami nwhile this relationship is never fully defined or anything we get sense of love between them and they have some truly interesting scenes between them she never gives him addresses or locales he always has to track her down nall of these elements clash together at the end in brilliantly executed emotional climax which is inevitable nwhen say inevitable mean we see it at the beginning and then backtrack putting great spin on it nsure it going to eleveate some of the tension but it gives the film lot of depth as carlito is seen trapped by fate nwhat amazing is the big chase sequence amazingly done by de palma has lot of tension and thrills nlike apollo 13 we know what going to happen but we re still thrilled by what happens in the middle nit also very emotional thanks to great script by david koepp and amazing performances by pacino and miller nde palma is famous or infamous for lots of violence in his films nhis earlier flim scarface which starred pacino in the lead has ton of it especially at the end and nasty chainsaw scene towards the beginning which m still not over nbut de palma actually reigns in more quieter scenes nto me the best scene in the film is when carlito is on top of building looking down into the room where gail is doing ballet nthis is the most brilliantly done and most emotionally stimulating scene in the entire film and probably the best in de palma film history nwith gorgeous soprano duet in the background and rain pouring down onto trashcan lid covering carlito head and saddened remorseful look on pacino face it a tear jerker well for me dunno about you nthe acting from all is great especially from the three leads npacino was panned for his performance chiefly because his accent wasn puerto rican enough and well it wasn as strong as his oscar winning role in scent of woman nwell his scent of woman performance was great and all but it was nothing really but as comic kevin pollack said foghorn leghorn impression nin carlito way he emotional and strong despite the fact that he remorseful over his entire lifestyle which he cannot change ni felt more for carlito brigante than did for the tango dancing insult throwing blind guy in scent of woman nas said penelope ann miller is great and she and pacino actually have very good chemistry nand they re scenes are well written with some good clever dialogue which adds some interest to an otherwise bland relationship nand sean penn is amazing as the coke addicted rat attorney nevery scene he in he has great energy and even measures up to the greatness that is pacino nin smaller roles john leguiziamo and luis guzman are great carlito way is one of those films which you heard about briefly but when you finally watch it you re

              " 'mandingo has traditionally been seen as one of two things either much needed revisionist look at slavery in the south or in the words of film critic leonard maltin trashy potboiler that appeals only to the m crowd nactually think mandingo is strange combination of the two although it fails on both fronts nit too trashy to be good drama but too dramatic to be good trash nthe story takes place on dilapidated louisiana plantation run by crotchety old warren maxwell james mason and his son hammond perry king none day in new orleans hammond comes across slave trader selling mandingo named mede heavyweight boxer ken norton nalthough the movie never explains it mandingo is simply the name for africans who come from the region of the upper niger river valley naccording to the movie mandingos were the rolls royce of african slaves nhammond pays top price for mede and has to fight off others in order to get him nhammond then spends his time training mede to be fighter in money brawls with other slaves nmeanwhile hammond has married his cousin blanche susan george because she wants to escape her family and he is under pressure from his father to produce grandchild nhammond however is happier spending nights with his bed wench the derogatory name given to female slaves used by their masters for easy sex nit is quickly apparent that hammond despite his overt racism is more in love with his bed wench sensitive slave girl named ellen brenda sykes than he is with blanche nhammond considers blanche tainted goods because he finds out on their wedding night that another man had pleasured her before he did nof course it fine that he slept with numerous slave girls but the fact that his wife white lady had been with another man out of wedlock destroys his capacity to care for her nso blanche is usually left lonely and sex starved while hammond is sleeping with ellen nblanche gets back at hammond by seducing the studly mede and bearing his child nhammond and his father cannot stand the idea that blanche has given birth to half black child although it okay that ellen was pregnant by hammond so warren kills the child by letting it bleed to death after birth and hammond poisons blanche nhammond then finds mede shoots him twice in the shoulder and pushes him into giant cauldron of boiling water nyes you read right the film ends with hammond getting his revenge by boiling mede alive njudging only by the plot mandingo is pure sexploitation nthe main purpose of the film seems to be getting as many blacks and whites into bed together as possible with only the slightest commentary on what that would mean in 19th century southern society nwhen mandingo was released in 1975 it was still bit of shocker to see miscegenation on screen in such graphic detail this way the movie could revise cinematic history while attracting large audiences of curious voyeurs ndramatically mandingo is weak and unfocused and historically it mostly confused nif one were to judge history by this film it would be easy to walk away with the notion that the entire system of american slavery was based on sexuality not economics nnot once in the film do we see any of the slaves working except for few house servants nthe men spend most of the time sitting around while the sole purpose of female slave seems to be free sex for the owner nthere is historical basis in the notion that slave owners often slept with their female slaves but mandingo overwhelming emphasis on this aspect of slavery gives the movie the unpleasant taste of cheap sex flick although there plenty of violence fights vicious beatings shootings and the aforementioned human boiling sequence thrown in for good measure nsome tried to write off mandingo as blaxploitation film one of number of quickly made low budget films appealing to black sensibilities in the early seventies but it not that easy mandingo was studio financed by paramount pictures and produced by dino de laurentiis the grandiose italian producer behind such notorious productions as the bible 1966 the remake of king kong 1976 and the ill fated dune 1984 nthe director was richard fleischer veteran who was best known for several special effects laden action movies including 20 000 leagues under the sea 1954 and fantastic voyage 1966 as well as such superior suspense films as the narrow margin 1952 nthe script based on the supermarket best seller by ken ostott and the subsequent play by jack kirkland was penned by norman wexler who had been nominated for an oscar two years earlier for his work on serpico njames mason perry king and susan george were well known and respected actors mason already had three oscar nominations under his belt and ken norton appeared to have promising film career nso why is mandingo so bad na number of reasons including the fact that all those experienced filmmakers behind and in front of the camera did lousy job nwexler script is pure poor hokum bordering on the offensive it combines stereotyped slave talk yessuh massuh stereotyped southern white trash talk fer whut re you gittin outta bed and stereotyped contemporary militant black talk if you see me hang you gonna know you killed black brother nfleischer direction is clumsy especially during the fight scenes and all the actors give weak performances especially susan george whose constant shrieking finally becomes laughable nnevertheless credit should be given where credit is due ndespite its exploitative nature mandingo was one of the first hollywood movies to take an alternative look at slavery nuntil then there had been kind of underlying racism in all hollywood films dealing with slavery neven classics such as gone with the wind 1939 can be seen as inherently racist by its glossing over the subject matter mandingo reassessed the south and showed that it wasn all beautiful plantations green fields and pretty sunsets nbut all this is constantly undermined by the film negligible point of view it claims to see things from the black perspective but the entire narrative focus is on the soap opera tales of the white owners nwith little more maturity and different handling mandingo might have been an effective worthwhile film nwhile it portrays many sensitive aspects of slavery it never deals with them nthe issues the movie brings up are worthwhile but wexler script refuses to move them beyond surface level of trashily vicarious viewing nthere is great deal of potential in honestly exploring the nature of sexual relationship between slave and owner but mandingo never does it nsteven spielberg touched on that same topic in schindler list 1993 by looking at nazi officer writhing in inner turmoil because of his feelings for jewish maid nthe difference between that film and mandingo is that spielberg dealt with the situation in fair unexploitive manner that focused on the inherent human dilemma mandingo is satisfied to simply show some skin and because of that its trashy potboiler nature overshadows any potential social good it might have accomplished ',\n",

              " 'if anything stigmata should be taken as warning against releasing similarly themed films relatively close to one another nof the four supernatural horror flicks released this year it is clearly the worst ni suppose should have seen this coming nafter all blair witch thoroughly creeped me out sixth sense was mildly spooky and then stir of echoes had its moments but wasn anything d lose sleep over nclearly the quality of the horror this summer has slowly been dropping nis it then any surprise that stigmata is the dullest most horribly executed piece of mtv influenced tripe have seen in long while nno not really npatricia arquette plays frankie page hairdresser from pittsburgh who receives rosary as gift from her globe trotting mother nas it turns out the rosary belonged to recently deceased brazilian priest nthe priest church had been under investigation by father andrew kiernan gabriel byrne because of the mysterious appearance of bleeding statue nfather kiernan is an investigator who has made career out of disproving supposed religious signs but this time he believes there is something to the bleeding statue nhis investigation is soon called off however when the frankie starts exhibiting signs of the stigmata in which person is inflicted with wounds like that of jesus christ nfather kiernan is initially skeptical of frankie story considering she an atheist but once he witnesses the stigmata attacks himself he dedicates himself to finding out what is going on nhe eventually begins to suspect that his boss cardinal houseman jonathan pryce is concealing something that could bring down the catholic church nas it turns out the dead priest had been working on the translation of fifth gospel before they were excommunicated nthe new rupert wainwright music video n ni mean film stigmata is the sort of film that starts off ok and only gets worse nindeed it would have been good if it were music video because it only interesting for about five minutes ni not sure what wainwright is trying to prove with his endless parade of slow motion double exposure and extreme close ups whoaaaaaa other than the fact that he has the most swelled head of any director in hollywood and yes he has been to film school nhis camera trickery is interesting for little while but eventually it becomes headache inducing nwhat this film needed is second audio track to be played over the dialogue such as it is with wainwright screaming at the audience see nlook at what can do ni an ex cellent dir ect or nmaybe then he explain why he decided to start half of his scenes with slow motion shots of water dripping in reverse or why he included random superfluous shots as that of an egg frying ooh scary nif there was some underlying meaning behind all this camera trickery didn see it njust when you thought it was safe to get involved in the story here comes double exposure shot of two patricia arquettes collapsing into bed for no reason whatsoever narrrrrrrghhhh n nthen again the superfluous camera trickery wouldn bother me if stigmata had story or characters that were remotely engaging nthough wainwright vanity certainly doesn help he does seem to have been given nearly unworkable script nwhere are plot continuity and character development when you need them ncase in point frankie page is the character that assume we are supposed to identify and sympathize with but we aren given any back story on her character or any reason to like her nthe extent of her character development seems to be that she is hard working hairdresser who can somehow afford cavernous apartment on the top floor of her building and she kind of cute so let start the bleeding nthe fact that she clearly not the brightest bulb in the drawer doesn help either naccording to frankie page what is the first thing to do after receiving mysterious wounds on your wrists and back ngo clubbing nsure that makes sense narquette byrne and pryce give it the old college try but their characters are so one dimensional that they just appear to be sleepwalking nscenes between arquette and byrne that were probably supposed to be sexually charged fall almost embarrassingly flat because the setup of the romantic subplot is so clumsily handled that it almost reaches the point of becoming laughable neven though frankie page life is falling apart before her very eyes she still finds the time to hit on priest who wanders in to her hair salon neven more curiously he seems to be interested in her advances nfather andrew religious doubt pops up so suddenly that it seems more silly than dramatic nas for pryce he may as well wear curled mustache and cackle ll get you my pretty for all the depth his cardinal houseman is afforded ntrust me m not revealing anything by telling you pryce turns out to be villain nwhat worse after being faced with dull characters and the prospect of having annoying camera tricks and loud music jammed down our throats we now have to contend with story that starts off in one direction veers off in another then another and ends up being totally incomprehensible nfirst of all the film doesn even bother to explain what should be very simple plot details how does frankie get the stigmata merely by touching rosary nhow come an atheist like her was chosen since father andrew mentions that only very devout believers have ever received stigmata nactually m not sure what frankie was posessed by nsupposedly stigmata occurs when one is posessed by the holy spirit but the film later has her being posessed by the dead priest and later by some evil spirit think nwhich one is it nthe answer to this question of course is very simple the possessing entity in each scene is determined by whichever effects and flashy camera work mr wainwright wants to use this time nfurthermore the ending is ridiculously neat little wrap up and the filmmakers compound this problem by ultimately turning the film into diatribe against the catholic church nif you do any research at all about the gospel of st thomas you ll find that it is not being suppressed by the church as the film seems to claim but that it is readily available at your local library nthere nothing the catholics need to worry about though stigmata religion is so off base that it can be confused for anything remotely resembling the real catholic church nif they wanted to portray catholic priests as mobsters they should have gone all out and equipped them with sharkskin suits and tommy guns which would have been far more interesting ni not catholic in fact don care much for the catholic church but its cartoonish misrepresentation in this film should not be considered realistic by any means nit rare to see film that fails on as many levels as stigmata does nit not thought provoking though it would like to be and it is definitely not scary though it pretends to be ni not sure why they tried to pass this off as horror film because there is absolutely nothing scary about the story nmaybe it an attempt to cover up the fact that none of the scenes have any dramatic weight whatsoever nthe initial shock of seeing arquette covered with blood is dulled by the fact that it happens over and over and over nlike so many films of the mtv generation this one suffers from overkill nso much is overdone in stigmata that it eventually has no effect on the audience leaving us to pick out the film many flaws ni also still trying to figure out why the quotation they take from the gospel of st thomas is so earth shattering nwhen we finally hear it the saying sounds like something every five year old learns on their first day of sunday school which means that for all its flash the whole film is really much ado about nothing nthe dog days of summer usually produce one monstrous dog and stigmata is it ',\n",

to write believable dialogue sample from reindeer games rule 1 never put car thief behind the wheel create multi faceted characters or even engineer coherent plots but he sure knows how to pile on numerous nonsensical twists and turns no matter if each one deems the actual story increasingly unlikely nhis screenplay for reindeer games turns the tables on the audience so many times that watching the film becomes something of punishment with no reward anywhere in sight ni can just envision kruger laughing behind his keyboard oh you thought my movie was gonna go here ck you jack ass take that twist decipher this mother cker nit almost as if the writer were angry at us for shelling out money to see his stupid movie nand why the hell would anyone want to invest time in movie when the screenwriter keeps changing his own rules for no reason other than to congratulate himself on how damn clever he is nauteur theory be damned it kruger style not the director that winds up on screen nkruger has obviously never paid much mind to the old chestnut sometimes less is more nand his numerous twists can even claim to be originals arlington rd ending is direct steal from the much better alan pakula thriller the parallax view and in reindeer games we get this ol gem character incriminates themself by saying something they shouldn know pronouns used to protect the gender of the character grammar nbe damned how did you know that nthe stunned protagonist asks suddenly realizing that the character was in on the whole thing all along n nsince twist endings are currently so in vogue and seeing as how kruger screenplays usually come equipped with about three twists per ending guess it no wonder why he works so frequently nhe quickly becoming miramax mickey mouse the company has already signed him to work on several of their upcoming projects nthis is appropriate considering that miramax which used to place their label on some of the most artistically daring films has quickly become grindhouse for coddling foreign imports life is beautiful and freddie prinze jr vehicles ntheir company current logo could be we ride the trends nreindeer games stars ben affleck as rudy supposedly hardened criminal spending his days and nights behind bars with fantasies of pecan pies dancing atop his head nalthough affleck is given some barbed wire tattoos to insinuate bad assness he plays the role like steve guttenberg preciously mugging through police academy flick naffleck is such puppy dog that it impossible to believe he could survive in harsh prison environment without becoming nearly everyone bitch nthe role itself is so badly written the character only grows balls when the plot calls for it the twists so outrageous and the directing so self consciously gritty that this is about as close to self parody as can recall recent serious movie getting nit may have been wiser had the film makers simply went all the way in that direction casting jerry seinfeld as the hardened criminal and howard stern as the sniveling bad guy who played here by gary sinise in yet another over the top villain performance njames frain is nick rudy cellmate manslaughterer who found pen pal in the gorgeous ashley mason charlize theron nashley is prison groupie who sends nick many cheesecake photos of her though she never seen one picture of him nwhich works out fine since the character is killed in near riot and rudy who was to be paroled on the same day as nick takes his place which leads to sudden and very frenzied sex scene between ashley and rudy so frenzied it kinda looks like rape and surprise visit from ashley brother gabriel gary sinise who waltzes into their shabby hotel room flanked by his thuggish co horts nhe plans to rob an indian casino on christmas eve with the assistance of rudy who he thinks is nick who according to what he wrote in the letters to ashley used to work as guard in the indian casino nthough by the end the film pulls the rug out from under us so frequently that everything ve described might as well be irrelevant nthis is what you can expect should you chose to take this reindeer on several scenes in which after catching his prey the bad guy proceeds to stall interminably until the good guy has chance to kill his captor and crack stupid one liner nincluded two 2 scenes of two 2 different bad guys explaining their motives to the hero when they should be killing him one following the other no less nthough it an action film the ending is more talkfest where we get the whole movie explained to us by one flustered character actor after another while affleck looks on incredulous as the audience nthe flick was directed by john frankenheimer straightforward action director who lucked into the manchurian candidate early in his career fell off the list following string of flops and now in his old age is slowly climbing his way back up nit would be success story if he were choosing better scripts but his last major film was ronin one of those almost but not quite movies which followed the island of dr morneau you remember the one with marlon brando in mime make up and not so flattering moo moo and now this nhe films action sequences with minimum of quick cutting which like considering that nowadays action scenes are commonly comprised of millisecond flash cuts strung together and laid out for brain zapped mtv audience to pick apart nproblem is these action scenes nearly all failed escapes serve no purpose in the story other than to further pad out the running time and to remind the audience that their watching an action movie rather than filmed radio play ncharacter problems abound rudy is made to shift between sweet boy next door earnestness and hard edged wiseacre the latter of which is not at least at this point something ben affleck is capable of pulling off nthe former he can do with ease and often the actor coasts on his lackadaisical charm while those around him growl and swear nbut then suddenly affleck starts growling and swearing alongside them like the class clown imitating tarantino gangster ncharlize theron an extraordinary talent is like affleck playing whatever part the script requires her to play whether it be vulnerability at one moment anger at the next nshe never has chance to evince any charm or make much of an impression beyond her obvious physical attributes frankenheimer has her needlessly pop her top to further italicize this ngary sinise has played this role frequently and here as in snake eyes he does the snarling bad guy thing with such over the top vitriol the guy must be so incredibly bored of stomping through the same paces that going out of control is the only thing that keeps him interested any more that it becomes more of an annoyance oh there he goes again than threat nthese are talented people who made the mistake of jumping on to script with little but stock characters and bag of tricks that it dully

poverty nello finds happiness in his life in spite of difficult times they are renting spare one room cottage and the greedy malevolent landlord who owns it threatens to throw them out of the house if they don pay the rent nnello also has rather creative talent for drawing some of the most beautiful pictures that have ever seen in either movie or in real life his hero is peter paul rubens the great flemish painter of the 17th century nnot that these are the only things that make nello life happy however nhe has dog of flanders whom he names patrasche who is heroic rin tin tin of the 19th century whom he rescues from his cruel unkind master nin addition he even has best friend and future sweetheart in the lovely wealthy aloise whose father strongly disapproves of her hanging out with lower class nello he thinks he not good enough for her and he would hate the idea of the two kids marrying nbut then he was poor guy himself before he married as mentioned later on in the film none day nello encounters mysterious yet kindhearted artist named michel la grande played wonderfully by jon voight who tells the boy to keep drawing from his heart and that perhaps one day he might land career in being an artist nand every christmas there is contest on which is the most beautiful painting of the year the winner getting lot of money neager to save his home and his aging dying grandfather nello willingly decides to become an artist asking aloise to pose for him none night the two travel to circus where they have their fortune told one of the film most delightful scenes that great happiness is destined for them nshe gives the kids ring whom nello places on aloise hand afterwards the two kids have rollickingly good time dancing around in front of circus performers nunfortunately things are not all la dee dah in this tale naloise father finally becomes so angry with nello that he forbids him to ever see aloise again nbad enough that they can see each other although we know nello and aloise don we but that only the start of nello troubles naloise farm is burned down and nello is wrongfully accused by the landord of his cottage for starting the fire in order to take revenge on being forbidden to see aloise nthis decreases nello reputation around the town save aloise and her parents and kindly miller william who is very sweet to nello every time he drops by nmatters get much worse for nello when his grandfather dies and he has to pay for his funeral nbut then things really get nasty when the landlord exiles nello from his own home for not paying his rental permanetly nthis means that nello and patrasche have to starve and walk out in the cold freezing wind nworst of all the painting that he has desperately been working on during all this time the portrait of the princess fails to win the prize at the festival nnow nello and patrasche are really depressed and close to freezing to death nwill nello be able to find any happiness in his life nwill patrasche save the day nwill nello make the fateful trip to join his mother and grandfather in paradise na dog of flanders is delightful heartwarming family film that is sure to entertain kids of all ages neven older ones who consider themselves too sophisticated for kiddie fare will be surprised to hear that this film is for grown ups too nthere have been other movies of this ilk boy and dog and while this one falls into that category it is mostly story about overcoming difficulties and finding good home for yourself nmove over or rather roll over old yeller this dog of flanders is heartwarming delight nthe cinematography courtesy of walther van den ende is beautiful and really adds to the powerful drama of the film nit also gives feel of being in flanders the whole film was respectably shot in flanders nthe music from richard friedman is also remarkable an evocative poignant score that recaptures music from the 19th century nthe opening song over the credits is very beautiful hope the soundtrack is available and there a brief excerpt of cheer up charlie from willy wonka and the chocolate factory sung by aloise to nello in another delightful scene nthe cast is first rate jesse james and jeremy james kissner who play nello are some of the most endearing adorable young stars have ever seen in my whole life so are the girls who play aloise madyline sweeten as the younger and farren monet as the older nnot that they are the only good stars however njack warden is ideal as jehan eliciting just the right amount of humor and compassion required for the character the scenes involving him and nello are heartwarming touching ones nalso bruce mcgill is charming as the kindly miller william nhe another one of my favorite characters in the film nbut jon voight as mentioned before is the perfect choice for michel nhe brings mysterious yet gentle performance that makes us all feel good again when he reassures insecure nello that he can win the contest nbut what makes this film fun to watch is how well defined the characters are and the pace of the story best of all it has happy ending though will not give it away sorry is strong and powerful enough for us to identify with the characters nfor the first time since the beginning of 1999 there comes film which doesn rely on popular formula stuff such as big budget special effects commercial rock soundtracks or any of that stuff nthis one relies on telling fully character oriented story with just the right amount of heart humor and drama nthat to me is what makes dog of flanders all the more delightful neleanor sullivan of the home news tribune noticed this and was kind and generous enough to welcome it for want of better word glow surrounds dog of flanders nits heart is in the right place and it engages you nyou can guess where the film is going because this is well traveled territory but with pros like voight and appealing young performers like kissner an often told story is well worth revisit nin addition there were couple of other enthusiasts such as chicago sun times and the washington post you should read their reviews they re really positive nother critics however were not so kind nstephen holden of the new york times had more than share of beatings to lay upon dog of flanders via pen writing nhe found the film to be sea of sugary bromides and condemned mr voight character as hopelessly wooden adopts an accent even more indeterminate than the one he came up with for anaconda nin addition entertainment weekly slam dunked the film condemning it as the worst family film of the year nthere have been so many other bad reviews like this too nmy suggestion disregard the critics nthey just have big problem with touching family films and one should never pay attention to them nthis dog of flanders may only be little family movie it probably won be big hit in the style of titanic but then again no other film has been since then but that is not bad thing in and of itself nthis is story that is sure to warm your heart and that is what really matters about dog of flanders nit is also one of the better family films around this year nnone of the other films have seen this year though they were good have been so low key and touching nif you re looking for family style entertainment look no further than this charming boy and dog yarn ngo see it while you still can for as mentioned it might not be big bow wow at the box office for long time nsee it while you can nthere is really no need to compare multi million dollar blockbuster such as star

              " 'steven spielberg is now considered as one of the hollywood deities because of the rare capability to deliver both huge commercial hits like jurassic park and oscar awarded critical triumphs like schindler list nhowever in the 1970s spielberg built his reputation by creating works of art that could slip in both categories none of them is close encounters of the third kind extremely popular and influential science fiction spectacle nunfortunately it had bad luck to be released in the same year as star wars nalthough both films have lot in common ground breaking special effects brilliant score by john williams their future was different one became an unstoppable cult phenomenon and another almost forgotten and stuck forever in its shadow nwhen spielberg began work on that project he was already established as bright new hollywood star due to his previous commercial hit jaws ntogether with other young directors of his new hollywood generation like kauffman carpenter hill and millius he exploited the great creative freedom of 1970s when even the mainstream producers dared to experiment nironically it was spielberg himself whose later commercial success would established new unwritten rules of blockubuster philosophy nbut in the mid 1970s many things were different spielberg was young and eager to use hollywood resources for his very personal and artistic movie nalthough very personal spielberg screenplay was partly based on the book ufo experience by dr allen hynek and in many ways inspired by the popular urban mythology of extraterrestrial visitors to earth that began to grow in the world after ww2 nspielberg was not only inspired by the mythology but his movie also gave the mythology itself huge boost unmatched until the contemporary era of files and the roswell anniversary nthat was partly because he made the movie very realistic using the authentic ufo related incidents as the element of the plot nthe story begins with one of such incidents team of international scientists come to the sonorra desert in mexico to find the s navy planes of who went missing decades ago during the famous flight 19 nsuch events coincide with the ufo incident witnessed by roy neary richard dreyfuss power company worker from muncie indiana who later becomes obsessed with his experience nbecause of his obsession he loses his job family and sanity but his loss is nothing compared to the experience of jillian guiler melinda dillon single mother whose son becomes the victim of alien abduction nin the meantime the scientists decipher the strange signals from outer space and s government in co operation with the french led by lacombe francois truffaut begin with the preparation for ultra secret project nwhen the news of the poison gas leak in the middle of wyoming reach neary he finally sees some sense in all his visions and begins the perilous journey toward the centre of endangered area nthere he is joined by jillian who shared the similar visions ntwo of them must break through military pickets and reach their destination to find whatever is there nspielberg here shows great mastery by using the very same techniques of jaws to make completely different effects nthe slow gradual yet very disciplined series of dramatic incidents close encounters is set in order to bring the viewer to the great revelation in the finale nbut instead of the fear and horror we had to endure during the jaws we are now overwhelmed by the sense of boyish wonder nthroughout the movie the viewer knows that something big magnificent and wonderful is about to happen and great magician spielberg delivers his promise in the end nthe last sequence with its even in this age impressive special effects by the great virtuoso douglas trumbull would leave many mouths open none of the great virtues of this film is its optimism naliens who almost always get portrayed as the monsters in science fiction cinema are here benevolent and harmless creatures and the first contact between them and humanity is beginning of something wonderful nit is very ironic when we consider that the two classic sf movies that visually inspired spielberg actually told quite different story howard hawks thing and byron haskin war of the worlds presented extraterrestrials as the threat to the mankind nspielberg humane approach and faith in the future also lies in great contrast to the pessimistic mood of its era the only hint of the contemporary gloom is post watergate portrayal of government as conspiratorial towards the public nbut even such government is much more harmless compared to the murderous and chain smoking men in black that became the stereotype thanks to files and its more cynical and disturbing visions nthere lies the main and probably the only flaw of this great picture lack of conflict and consequently lack of drama nthe movie has few excitements or even action scenes especially the last that may be an interesting homage to hitchcock north by northwest but generally almost everyone neary jillian government aliens are the good guys ndespite such shortcomings the actors were good and manage to bring multidimensionality to their simple roles nrichard dreyfuss is very convincing as ordinary yet nice guy who sinks into insanity only to rediscover himself in grand finale nmelinda dillon was on the other hand nominated for oscar as struggling mother yet she was overshadowed by teri garr as neary long suffering wife ronnie napart from visual wonders of this film spielberg semi official composer john williams again excels by his beautiful music this time using the simple melody both as the element of plot and as the basis for his score nthe aliens who are the main subject of this film were visually very convincing ntoo convincing one of my acquaintances in the ufo researching circles said naccording to him the depiction of extraterrestrials as grey skinned little people with big eyes was so accurate that it managed to freak out powerful government figures interested in suppressing the truth about ufos nso they later approached spielberg and ordered him to make another movie with alien this time designed to be anything but the real life nthe result was t for many years the biggest commercial hit of all times yet less inspirational for ufo enthusiasts nanyway whether the viewer believes in existence of extraterrestrials or ufos close encounters of the third kind remains the great movie and one of the rare uplifting experiences in modern cinema ',\n",

things campbell gives stunning performance this twisty plot will have you dazzled for days oh yeah the day newspaper uses these is the day neve campbell falls in love with me nnow onto more serious stuff and with this film mean that in nearly sarcastic way nwild things has single handedly broken down the rules surrounding the rating from the mpaa ni not saying that in bad way but when you see this film you may be shocked by what you see nhowever perhaps the mpaa was pleased by the film charming cast and tricky plot that they let the film slide with an rating nbeing mormon m bound to hear an uproar from religious zealots warning me not to see the film ntrouble is have already seen it nand like it nwild things is film noir of the 90s filled with 40s sensibilities and yet breaking the rules and modern day taboos of 90s culture nthe style in which it is filmed is rich in color nthe actors are all gorgeous people seemingly drawn from the same gene pool and placed into this film nsure it all too good to be true but ain it fun to watch nwhen movies like this come along sort of better version of basic instinct there is bound to be people who either love it or hate it nthere will be people who don want to admit liking what they see but tell you most anyone who sees this will like it nwild things begins at blue bay high school the one high school in the world that any teenager would love to get into nit almost as if students are put through entrance exams just for admittance totally based on looks alone nof course there are those select few who may look slightly ugly but compared to the average person they are gorgeous nimmediately the film finds its tone and the audience settles in for an enjoyable time nwe can turn off our brains right nwrong nwhile you may be expecting one thing to happen it certainly doesn turn out that way nthe film begins in classroom with nearly all the main characters present nthere sam lombardo matt dillon counselor for the students nhe heading the class discussion nthere also kelly van ryan denise richards snobby rich teen who has fallen in love with sam nteaching the class however are two policemen ray duquette kevin bacon and gloria perez daphne rubin vega who want to talk about sex cheers crimes boos what is sex crime nray asks not gettin any none student responds nthis pretty much sets the tone of the film we are about to watch nhowever upon hearing this one student suzie toller neve campbell stands up and leaves the room commenting that they can both kiss part of her body nand so wild things sets into motion nquickly kelly begins hitting on sam but sam doesn want anything to do with her advances nkelly is stubborn and continues to pursue him nshe even pleads with him to let her wash his jeep nsurprisingly that really all can tell you about the plot nany more would give away one of the many crucial plot twists nand what more these plot twists are actually unpredictable ngoing along the way of scream wild things maintains that film surprises and then adds even more to them nthere are more plot twists in this film than probably any have ever seen nand even though you think you may get tired of them the surprises are so genuine that it rather pleasing ngoing back over them in my mind nearly all of them work though some stretch the boundaries of belief nthankfully the convoluted plot doesn give us much time to think about each one pouncing yet another twist on us before the shock of the previous one has worn off nas for the critics who complain that the film is trashy well it is nthis is pretty much just one trashy film nhowever it is the kind of trashy that isn hard to watch nit good trash in sense none the screenplay knows that it not to be taken seriously and it includes lot of humor and satire into the story nthis varies everywhere from kelly mother theresa russell who is more of caricature of rich people all the way to an ambulance chasing lawyer bill murray who wears neck brace to cover an insurance scam he is running nbill murray also provides the best character in the film and most of the genuine laughs nand two the sex is more than gratuitous although not unwelcomed nwild things is supposed to have sex in it what film with that title wouldn and this movie breaks the boundaries ninstead of having heterosexual sex scenes it also includes lesbian scenes between denise richards and neve campbell don worry nit not as graphic as you might think nthe heterosexual scenes are quite graphic but the surprise shocker is kevin bacon full frontal nude scene nit very brief so if you blink you may miss ahem it nand for as long as can remember don think have seen an rated film show an erect one before it not completely but judging from the audiences reaction it was more than they expected too nalso during one scene late in the film there seemed to be relationship brewing between bacon and dillon characters but nothing came of it makes you wonder if the director had to cut it in order for the rating or if the actors refused to do it nwhat first made me want to see wild things was its cast nneve campbell of course has been one of my favorite actresses since the scream films were released nhere however she turns every typical role she has done on its head and plays gothic pothead nthe closest role to this was her performance in the craft though even in that she was nice girl ncampbell is probably the best in the film and shows her wide range of talent nyou can tell she will be around for long time ndenise richards will also be around for long time although she may be limited to the roles without much range nhere she gets to express more emotions than in her stiff yet effective performance in starship troopers nhopefully one day she will land very good role that can display her ability nand then there is daphne rubin vega newcomer to the movies nshe gives very good performance although her character is mostly left to the background for the first hour and half ntowards the end she does get bigger part non the male side matt dillon is probably the best giving subtle performance that surprises with every twist nkevin bacon has slightly wooden character but he makes the most of it nyou must have admiration though for what he did on screen nand judging from many of the women reactions in the theater to that shot they have grown deeper appreciation for bacon yeah right nand then there is bill murray nhis performance is the comic relief and he nearly steals the film nas whole the entire cast works wondrously together and they seem at home even when doing the menage troi ndirector john mcnaughton who has previously done the critically acclaimed henry portrait of serial killer has constructed wonderfully twisty plot that works nhis direction is smooth and stylish nthe visuals are striking filled with rich colors and almost so realistic that we can actually breathe the humidity in the air nhowever he seems more at home when the actors aren talking nhis fly by shots of the swampy areas are brilliant and his photography of denise richards climbing out of the pool is highlight nthe cinematography is gorgeous in its details its not often that you see film like this and we should watch it just to see how the camera can take pictures nthen there is the music nthis was probably the most obvious thing to me as it set the perfect mood for the film nit hard to describe in words so just see the film and listen to it nit wonderfully composed and presented nand be sure to stick around during the closing credits nmcnaughton has finally put the ending credits to good use while most comedies use it for outtakes nhe has included some small scenes which help explain the preceding events nsome may say that these are lame attempts to explain the convoluted plot but it an entertaining way to finish the film nplus there are some shocking moments in these ending credits which just add to the fun nwild things is appropriately rated for strong sexuality nudity language and violence nagain the nudity is rather unnecessary but let face it people want to see it nso why not give it to them nneve campbell admirably has no nudity clause in her contract and the most you see of her is from behind as she takes her top off way to go neve nthe sex scenes are graphic especially the first one we see between the mother and one of her deck hands none almost wonders how they got away with the rating nthe language is quite harsh too ranging from sexual innuendo to your average everyday profanity nand can stress it enough don allow kids under 18 to see this film nthe target age for the movie is the 18 24 range and that who should see it nit definitely not for those under 18 ndid mention that this film is rated however for those that do get chance to watch it you will probably more likely be pleased and may even take friends to see it the next time ',\n",

numbingly bad dialogue in supergirl ni ll admit it ni love superman iii ni know it hated amongst the superman faithful who dismiss it as nothing more than vehicle for richard pryor but still think it a worthy addition to the man of steel franchise nsupergirl spin off film of sorts from the series same producers alexander and ilya salkind doesn even rival superman iii in terms of quality let alone superman or superman ii nsupergirl lost me from the opening scenes and went steadily downhill for the rest of its two hour plus running time nas the film begins we see the residents of argo city commune like place consisting of refugees from krypton which resides in inner space go about their daily lives nok nwhat nso these are exiles from krypton which blew up right nwere they living there before krypton exploded nhow do you get to inner space nthis whole inner space notion is never explained particularly in terms of how these people get information from the outside world nhow do they know where superman went nhow do they know he took the name clark kent and now works at the daily planet nthese kinds of things frustrate the hell out of me nargo city is kept running by power source called the omegahedron none day the founder of argo city zaltar peter toole gives the omegahedron to superman cousin kara helen slater for use as inspiration in her art nkara uses it to create bug like thing which immediately crashes through the layer of whatever that protects the city nin the chaos the omegahedron sails out through the opening dooming the argonians to death nin three days time or something nkara then climbs into pod which zaltar had designed for interdimensional travel and chases after the omegahedron to save her world nthe power source travels directly to earth and lands in the bowl of dip belonging to minor league witch named selena faye dunaway who immediately before her dip was ruined announced her desires to rule the world to her sometimes warlock boyfriend nigel peter cook nselena somehow knows that this ball from the sky will help her with her evil plans and she sets out to achieve world domination nselena is unaware of course that kara has also arrived on earth and that she arrived as supergirl complete with appropriate costume nsupergirl emerges from the bottom of lake when she arrives nok nhuh nwhy does the omegahedron fall from the sky but supergirl shoots out of the bottom of lake nattention movie explain yourself ni sorry can only suspend disbelief so much ni can buy into any of this nonsense just because the movie wants me to nknowing that she needs secret identity supergirl basically wills herself into school girl outfit complete with different hairstyle picks the alias linda lee and enrolls into school nshe given her dorm assignment and who happens to be her roommate nlois lane sister lucy nok coincidence is one thing folks but we re getting really contrived now nwhat follows are some generic all girls school hijinks ncomplete with evil bully girls mean for no reason of course and even shower scene nbest moment though comes when supergirl decides to put bra on over her school uniform and starts stuffing it with socks nat this point m rapidly wondering why m bothering with this nonsense nthere is some credit to give to the film however none lengthy and elaborate sequence featuring an evil bulldozer destroying small town in search of its prey is very well done nalso its commendable to see genders reversed in the film whereas the women have all the power and the men are merely objects and tools nhart bochner die hard is particularly fun as kara love interest lovesick landscaper who is under spell cast by selena although he is unfortunately part of one of the film more ridiculous moments when he has to be rescued from being tapped by some menacing bumper cars nthen there were numerous little things that bothered me nthe flying effects are never convincing for moment nit all too obvious that helen slater is hooked to wires ninstead of having her look like she flying the filmmakers wanted her to be graceful so she poses lot and does ballet type maneuvers nalso who are the first two humans to meet supergirl when she arrives on earth na pair of truck drivers rapists who immediately attack her and then meet wacky demise nthere is also some rampant product placement in the film most notably for popeye tylenol and w root beer with the latter actually putting its logo on the shirt of one of the rapists nfinally just one word monsters nfaye dunaway and peter toole ham it up unmercifully however when toole overacts he entertaining and when dunaway does it she annoying her character actually says the line seize them nat one point ndunaway henchmen played by peter cook and brenda vaccaro fare much better with vaccaro coming off best as the equivalent of ned beatty otis character from the first two superman movies nhelen slater effectively portrays supergirl as the innocent naive character she written to be as she able to gaze at flowers and bunnies with the right amount of genuine wonder to make it believable nbelievability aside though it still annoying nnow despite all this negativity and m not alone here supergirl is not well liked nor well respected movie in many circles leave it to the good people at anchor bay entertainment to actually make people not only interested but excited about its release on dvd nthey have released two separate editions of the film on dvd to the delight of many people including myself nyet m still unclear as to why since this movie is so awful nthe first and most widely available dvd release features the international version of the film which runs 10 minutes longer than the print which ran in s theaters nthe movie is presented in its original theatrical aspect ratio of 2 35 1 is enhanced for 16x9 televisions and has been remastered in full thx glory nextras on the disc include full length audio commentary track with director jeannot szwarc and special project consultant scott michael bosco the excellent 50 minute documentary from 1984 called supergirl the making of feature dig that workout montage 5 trailers 3 tv spots talent bios in depth storyboards accompanied by score from the movie and assorted still galleries nthe transfer on this international version is incredible nyou think you were watching new release nimages are sharp colors jump off the screen and the picture is free of scratches or artifacts nonly some special effects sequences show the wear of time and there just isn much that can be done about that unless you re obsessive like george lucas nthe new thx approved audio is loud and clear in all the right places however you ll be hearing absurd dialogue and mediocre jerry goldsmith score which is completely unrelated to john williams classic superman theme and sounds better suited for cannon films golan globus production nthe commentary track featuring director szwarc and project consultant bosco is step in the right direction in the evolution of audio commentaries nbosco seems to be an expert in all things supergirl and is there with szwarc to ensure that there no dead air on the track nbosco probes szwarc for information on virtually everyone and everything that comes onscreen and we learn great deal more about the film as result of his participation nalthough at times you can tell that bosco is looking for specific response from szwarc and is surprised when he doesn get that response nwe learn some fascinating tidbits on the track most notably the almost appearance in the film by christopher reeve ngreat detail is given about superman proposed role in the original script before reeve wisely dropped out nas it stands superman is written off early on in the film when we hear radio broadcast mention that he is billions of light years away on some sort of peace mission nfor the sake of brevity won even get into that one nszwarc also reveals that is was the conscious decision of the salkinds and everyone else agreed that supergirl needed to stand on its own replacing the science fiction of the superman films with cutsy whimsical fantasy nonsense nbosco also points out scenes not in the american release as they come along claiming that had they been in the original release it would have been hit at the box office nagain for the sake of brevity won even get into that one nanchor bay has also released limited edition only 50 000 copies pressed two disc set ndisc one contains everything mentioned for the regular release ndisc two features the never before seen director cut of the film which runs 138 minutes long nthe additions mainly consist of scene extensions which don add much of note except for few moments which lengthen peter toole screen time particularly during his latter appearances nthe print is rough in spots and the sound is only in mono but fans of the film won care none question though nshouldn the director commentary be on the director cut of the film ni never seen supergirl before sat down to watch this dvd ni was nine when it was released to theaters and even then was smart enough to inform my parents not to take me to see it nso when popped the dvd into my player and sat down in my easy chair had no idea what to expect ni knew the film wasn beloved and never had any interest in it before but was willing to give it shot because of the impressive amount of work put into the disc nas the disc began to spin was rather impressed with the opening sequence which made me sit up and wonder if my assumptions all this time could have been wrong ncome to find out however it was just the chase digital stereo logo nso slunk back into my seat as the nightmare started nat the end of the film supergirl flies back into the lake with the omegahedron and flies back to argo city nugh give up ni surprised even made it to the end of the film not once not twice but three times to review these discs nsupergirl is definitely terrific dvd package but very lousy movie pg ',\n",

              " 'in intolerance w griffith told four different historical stories at the same time cutting from one to the other neach of the stories builds to fast paced climax nin magnolia paul thomas anderson tells several stories each just tangentially connected to the others nyet the stories and where they are going are all independent nwhat is strange about these stories is that they are all synchronized neach story builds to tense moment or what appears to be intended to be tense moment but then lets the tension dissolve nwhile the tension dissipates one character starts singing song and in each plotline the major characters sing along even though they are not in the same scene nthen toward the end the stories each build to tense moment again nit is almost as if the characters are somehow psychically linked nthis creates some strange effects nthe stories are about empty desperate people with dysfunctional relationships nthe strands have varying degrees of bizarre content nwe have the story of dying man earl partridge jason robards wanting to get in touch with his son and make amends nphil parma philip seymour hoffman is his nurse who is frantic to help partridge achieve his final goal npartridge young wife linda julianne moore is getting more and more anxious as partridge dies but for an unsuspected reason nfrank mackey tom cruise runs the kinds of self help seminar that businesses like so much but he aims his at teaching disaffected men how to be real shit heels in dealing with women in an angry backlash to women lib nofficer jim kurring john reilly is patrolman who has need to feel he is making the world better place njimmy gator philip baker hall hosts popular children tv quiz show that really exploits and destroys children as we see from the stories of current quiz kid stanley spector jeremy blackman and former quiz kid donnie smith william macy nthe film juggles all these stories for over three hours but even after all this time not one story is resolved satisfactorily neach story moves toward single bizarre common climax but it is not one that seems to do much but derail each story nthe common climax itself is ambiguous in many ways and it fails to really tie up any of the stories nthe film seems to be built around strange events and weird history but it really has little to do with the content of the stories though they all are connected in part by one weird event nmagnolia will probably bring some much deserved attention to paul thomas anderson though in my opinion his two previous films hard eight and boogie nights were better told stories nit is interesting that one starts to look forward to actors from anderson company njohn reilly seems to be standard fixture nparticularly notable is philip baker hall who gave mesmerizing performance from the first scene of hard eight nhere he several of the characters are mesmerizing but that characteristic is not really used nas studies of characters these stories are each worth following nas well rounded stories with beginning middle and end they leave something to be desired nbut the film is willing to do the unexpected and that helps make the film worth sitting through ni rate it 7 on the 0 to 10 scale and low 2 on the 4 to 4 scale nheavy spoiler nheavy spoiler nheavy spoiler nheavy spoiler nduring the strange climactic event of the film we get multiple messages from the filmmaker that the event we are seeing really does happen nand in actual fact it does nsince biblical times rains of frogs have been interpreted as signs of displeasure of the gods nit is however perfectly natural if somewhat unnerving phenomenon nthe cause is associated with whirlwinds nwe know that tornadoes over land can rip up land and even objects of some size from the ground and hurl them into the air holding them aloft nthe reader may remember the unfortunate cow in twister nsmaller objects can be hurled high into the atmosphere and then be kept aloft by the updrafts for surprisingly long periods of time much as hail and chunks of ice are nwhen the whirlwind is over water animals near the surface frequently fish and frogs may suffer the same fate nessentially they are vacuumed up by the whirlwind held aloft by updrafts and finally dropped elsewhere nso while the rain is possible some doubts do creep in nthe rain of frogs depicted in this film may be of greater scale than had pictured for rain of frogs nit seems unlikely the frogs would still be alive when dropped nit is not clear that geographic conditions are right for los angeles to have this sort of phenomenon frankly have no idea on these points notherwise the event was quite believable nwhat we see in this film is much more credible than the phenomena we saw in volcano nin the film it is left ambiguous if the rain is sign from god since there are many references to exodus 8 2 and the frogs shall come up both on thee and upon thy people and upon all thy servants nhowever rain of frogs though it feels biblical is most definitely not biblical portent nnote that the previous verse says and the river shall bring forth frogs abundantly which shall go up nso the bible is referring not to rain but to an infestation from the river nthe only other reference to frogs in the bible is as symbol for uncleanness in revelation 16 13 ',\n",
              " 'frequent error is the categorization of terrorist as soldier or common criminal na soldier commits acts of violence sanctioned by one nation state against another na common criminal commits acts of violence for personal gain na terrorist employs random violence as means to political end nif the target nation does not affect the desired change in policy the violence continues nit is the fear resulting from the fact that the terrorist may strike at anyone even total innocents anywhere at anytime that gives the figure his label nedward zwick the siege explores the possibility of this kind of violence taking place right here in the united states nyou think the opening bit was ripped right from the headlines narab terrorists kill american citizens abroad and the s responds by retaliating against the sheik whom supposedly ordered the attack nhowever unlike the real life tomahawk cruise missile strike against bin laden camp and manufacturing facility the film version depicts special operations troops kidnapping sheik ahmed bin talal nin retaliation the terrorists bring the fight to the new world nunwittingly involved is fbi assistant special agent in charge anthony hubbard denzel washington who works out of the bureau new york office at one federal plaza nwhile investigating series of bombings in the big apple he encounters cia agent elise kraft annette bening also trying to uncover information ngenerally the fbi is charged with problems inside the s while the cia takes care of problems in the international realm neven spies from other countries are off limits to the cia as long as they are in our country nhubbard therefore finds it highly unusual that an agency spook is nosing around what he considers his territory but as the two form tentative professional relationship hubbard becomes more and more aware of an increasingly complicated series of allegiances and possibly illegal actions involving terrorism and the united states government nthe original tagline for patriot games was there has never been terrorist attack on american soil nhowever true it was pulled before the movie release because it sounded too much like dare nrevisiting the scenario of foreign terrorists committing acts of violence in the united states the siege is almost an invitation in itself because it shows just what kind of turmoil could be produced if an effective terrorist network were to set up operations here in america nadmittedly the terror wrought upon new york is bit excessive who going to believe that few bombs are going to cause new yorkers to jump at the backfire of bus or to curtail their shopping by two thirds but the basic premise is still valid ni liked the fact that this film rises above the basic action thriller fare of good guy men against bad guy terrorists by exploring some of the effects on society and law and order nit provides very possible hypothesis that violent activity on the part of few arabs would escalate into series of hate crimes against the arab american population and that in an effort to find the terrorists the civil liberties of the minority may be violated by the government itself nin fact about halfway through the film when the president authorizes the declaration of martial law within new york city the liberties of all americans are put at risk nalthough it may actually be side effect of terrorist campaign the demise of social order in america is scary thought and goal which would not be beneath many international terrorist groups nthroughout the film maintains conflict between hubbard who wants to use the fbi to pursue the terrorists within the letter of the law and general devereaux bruce willis who is in command of the army and of the mind that the greater good would be better served by suspending the law and pursuing the terrorists more forcefully nwhat results is fascinating debate over the appropriateness and constitutionality of the declaration of martial law and the invocation of the war powers act utilizing philosophy and historical examples to make points on both sides nit actually gets rather heady at times but it a credit to screenwriters zwick lawrence wright and menno meyjes that they don underestimate the intelligence of the audience ni don know if it his tone or inflection or something else but denzel washington has way of spitting out dialog that makes whatever he says sound great nthis combined with his innate acting ability and his experience in playing the mid level authority figure makes his performance in the siege convincing and enjoyable nannette bening gives one of the more assertive portrayals of female character ve seen recently and the chemistry she shares with washington is palpable nit somewhat unfortunate that her character fortitude is broken at certain point but it allows us to watch bening play little more range nbruce willis is pretty much relegated to tough guy role always standing straight and with permanent scowl fixed upon his face nhowever the tension that exists between devereaux and hubbard is major drive behind the film development nnotable is tony shalhoub who plays fbi agent frank haddad lebanese immigrant nthe role calls for evidencing both kind of filial pride for his heritage and contempt for those of his own race who might interfere with his integration into the american society ndifficult to say the least shalhoub does it with naturalness you can almost reach out and touch nperhaps best known for his role as antonio the cab driver in the nbc sitcom wings shalhoub gained notoriety for his dramatic abilities in the wonderful film big night nwhereas denzel washington seems to be edward zwick favorite actor he directed washington in glory and courage under fire james horner seems to be his favorite composer ni therefore found it odd that zwick chose the prolific score writer graeme revell seven films this year already over horner for the siege until realized that this film contained lot of arabian themed music and horner record has shown more of propensity for scores either neutral in ethnicity or irish sounding at most nrevell does good job at providing appropriate music to punctuate key scenes and allowing the score to enhance the movie as whole nit nowhere near as intrusive as in some of the other films we ve been getting throughout the year nmissteps in the siege can be found in couple of the excesses it takes nfor example it pretty clear throughout that the film is meant to be more of thriller than an action flick nunfortunately there a scene where the army just cuts loose against some arab immigrants in blatant display of firepower and explosions obviously meant for the sole purpose of being eye catching nin the middle of the city and against no real opposition zwick even has the army use cobra attack helicopter to shoot rockets into building no farther than 50 feet from friendly troops nverisimilitude really goes out the window at that point nthe film also gets little preachy toward the end focusing on the ability of different races to get along na noble gesture the film just puts the message across bit too obviously nthese flaws are glaring but they don detract too much from an otherwise good film that makes you think about issues you may not have considered since history class ',\n",

the sort of movie wish could ve had lot of fun with but didn ni just didn nsurely this film isn trying to win any major awards so should have expected an oscar caliber film nno but expected something na funny joke na clever prank na plot development nanything nthe movie never delivers nyou ve got to marvel at how the filmmakers managed to come up with movie that is truly about nothing detroit rock city is one of those films that you walk out of after the credits have rolled and realize that you just spent 90 minutes watching movie in which absolutely nothing happened to justify the film existence and it not very satisfying realization nthe film is about four teenage boys all huge kiss fans from cleveland trying to get into kiss concert in detroit michigan nthat it nthere is no big plot description in this review because the movie has very little plot nthe characters are hawk edward furlong lex giuseppe andrews trip james debello and jam sam huntington nthey have garage band nthey re pathetic like all garage bands but they like kiss and they like rock roll so guess that means we root for them nthey have tickets they lose them nthey get more tickets they lose those too nthey come up with crazy schemes to get tickets most of which backfire nthere not much more to it nfrankly it becomes little less than exciting to see them try to get kiss tickets about halfway through the film when total of eight tickets have already graced the boys hands only to be lost because of their sheer stupidity noh and jam real name jeremiah has really really annoying ultra religious mother who ought to be reported to the child welfare agency nshe doesn want them to see kiss if you hadn figured that out already nit really quite disheartening to see such fine soundtrack go to waste in pointless movie like this nwe ve got plenty of kiss along with some ac dc ramones and thin lizzy nthen again maximum overdrive had an awesome soundtrack me being the big ac dc fan that am but is probably one of the worst movies of all time detroit rock city doesn quite reach that level of ineptitude but it gets dangerously close nin fact the music is the only thing that keeps this movie from being complete failure in my mind nbasically the soundtrack has earned the film full half star which means all the bands involved can pat themselves on the back except for marilyn manson whose half hearted cover of ac dc highway to hell sounds like something my neighbor cat coughed up nit also really sad to see the talents of the cast go to waste because it evident that they re all trying really hard to squeeze some life out of this dead turkey of movie nedward furlong has done far better work than this and so has natasha lyonne and so has lin shaye but hey they ve got to make living in hollywood npeople wanting to see kiss and lots of it will probably be disappointed considering the band appears for about five minutes and plays one song ntoo bad they might have provided some energy to this mess ndirector adam rifkin knows he hasn got much material to work with so he takes chapter from the michael bay book of directing and keeps his camera spinning nwe get an endless parade of quick cuts split screens zoom outs zoom ins and rotating cameras all in an effort to cover up the sheer stupidity of the script nit fun for while but eventually it becomes disorienting ni would recommend that those who felt seasick at the blair witch project stay far away from detroit rock city because the witch has got nothing on this baby ni haven felt such an urge to reach out and

laughed was when priest gets stoned on marijuana laced pizza and that was just because it was so surreal nthe rest of the movie just seems like they just threw bunch of vulgar stuff up on screen and called it comedy nthere is no set up just succession of punchlines that don provide for much in the way of chuckles precisely because there was no set up nit as if they just whacked someone on the head pointed at him and said see nfunny nlook that woman was so shocked by hearing loud kiss music that she spilled her drink nsee nfunny nlook that guy just got clocked by telephone receiver ntwice nsee nfunny nlook that kid has been vomiting for 20 minutes after drinking an inordinate amount of alcohol and is now about to perform an exotic dance for money nsee nfunny na word of advice to mr

topic that can help but be glorified any way it is portrayed by the media nmovies documentaries and even history books have way of making the darker side of humanity exciting since the most general aspects are focused on such as strategy politics and victory nit easy to forget war in its most basic form is battle of armies out to slaughter each other nforgotten more easily is the fact that each soldier no matter what his rank or importance is real flesh and blood person and not just number saving private ryan is one of the few films that dares play up this aspect especially in its unapologetic realistic delivery nit proves there a huge difference between battling and killing nthe film opens with one of the most graphic disturbing scenes in recent memory nit world war ii day to be exact and the s military is invading omaha beach where the nazis are more than ready for them nspielberg uses many techniques to create for total sense of reality ninstead of positioned cameras the footage here seems to have been shot by camera operators running alongside soldiers as if they were just as scared nthere is no sense of stability but of constant anxious and confusing motion giving us the feeling of being in the middle of the battle and just vulnerable as the poor troops poor is proper word to describe how pathetic and yet innocent the men fighting are nthere is little to no dialogue throughout the loud battle and no prologue to define any characters nwe don get the feeling these are handsome actors playing heroic roles but that these are men about to kill and be killed for reasons beyond their understanding nthe nazis are not portrayed as enemies to be hated but as people that must be destroyed because they re there nin the movies the good guys can run through firestorm of bullets and bombs and not get scratch but in reality that wouldn happen nthe men have nothing to shield or protect them besides some metal flanks and dead bodies nthey are sitting ducks and we realize this through the perspective of the well secured germans who can actually see who what and where they re shooting unlike the americans who must fire in general direction to avoid getting their heads blown off nperhaps the film is flawed by not providing any backstory on the war itself and who the men really are but that seems to be part of the theme nthe film seems to rely on the audience sense of patriotism that the american military is right and good and that the nazis are inherently evil nthe battle scene eventually focuses on group of men who have miraculously survived and made their way close to the enemy stronghold whole 50 foot progression and begin to inflict some damage ni have to admit that once the first glimpse of victory over the nazis sprang up couldn help but feel some sense of joy and relief nto triumph against all odds is cliche to be sure but there nothing cliche about the graphic detailed atmosphere here because it really happened none of the most surprising aspects of the film is how little story construction there is and yet the events that take place make sense and are interesting nthe plot is practically irrelevant since the film is more concerned with the reality of the war and the soldiers we meet ntom hanks stars as captain miller relatively average man who happens to be the leader of platoon nhe never obsessive or any such generic cartoonish characteristic that might dominate character like this nhe doesn want to be there any more than his men but when he is given mission he intends to carry it out nthe mission the film is concerned with is as the title states saving private ryan nthrough series of command started by an ordinary clerical worker it is brought to general attention that three brothers from iowa have been killed in action and their mother will receive notices of each death simultaneously nwhen they learn fourth brother is stationed somewhere in europe they make it top priority to have him returned safely to his mother nit easy to sympathize with this situation after all no one should have to lose all their children at once nbut finding one man in this war is as miller puts it like trying to find needle in stack of needles nthe saving of private ryan isn just dramatic device but thematic one nhis salvation represents the sense of innocence the country the world even was trying to convince itself it still had nwhen miller company hears of the mission they scoff at the idea assuming he is dead but miller isn so quick to shrug it off nhe knows the only thing that can really save soldiers from death is hope and now he has the opportunity to make someone sense of hope reality nthe mission to find ryan gives miller group destination but not direction nalong the way many things happen to them both good and bad na few battles are fought not to be major accomplishments for the war but because they encounter german soldiers and have no other choice nthe act of killing itself becomes one of the film major philosophical metaphors nthe soldiers don mind killing other soldiers in blind battle but when they come across lone survivor who begs them to let him go they can barely stop themselves from killing him in cold blood as some kind of vengeance for their losses nunfortunately death is fact of war and most films try to avoid it when it comes to the main characters but here spielberg doesn want us to think these men are invincible nin fact only small amount of color and personality is sketched into each man and the performances are good enough to make this method work nalthough the characters are somewhat typical the actors maintain control over the material at all time nwhether they re arguing with each other telling stories of back home or fighting the germans they never go overboard and always seem believable nsure there a zinger here and there but war doesn change the fact boys will be boys nif and when one dies we too can feel the loss even though we hardly knew them nthe final act brings the story full circle with another tremendous violent battle sequence nprivate ryan has been found but facing four to one odds can the americans defeat the germans and keep ryan alive nthat not premise for thrills it symbolic of everything the film has worked for nit would be wrong to say the film has either happy or sad ending it ends the way it must end ni remember reading calvin hobbes comic strip where calvin asked his dad something like dad how do armies of men killing each other solve problems saving private ryan is the adult version of that question ',\n",

of the story was brisk nthere was no unnecessarily long setup explaining the concept behind the truman show just few quick title cards few interviews and then right into the show and the movie none of the first scenes is of the studio light falling there was no token scene of truman idyllic life before it falls apart because it wasn necessary we pick up the story at the first sign of trouble and no sooner nthere also no point in the movie where the plot slows down nit a quick straight shot to the movie end nin terms of overall quality would compare the truman show to niccol gattaca nboth films

the disco era heyday easy drugs and even easier sex between everyone all set to thumping dance beat nso when miramax started production on _54_ last year the buzz of hype and resulting anticipation began an edgy film as down and dirty as the club itself written and directed by promising first timer mark christopher and starring some hot young talent salma hayek neve campbell newcomer ryan phillippe and mike myers in his dramatic debut nmy how easily does the worm turn nhype turned into damage control when word got out about 11th hour reshoots wrapped only month ago rash of studio imposed edits that left virtually the entire cast and crew especially christopher unhappy and the very likely possibility that miramax would not screen the finished film for critics nat the last minute though miramax did decide to screen the film so hastily scheduled was the screening that myers last name was misspelled on the invitation not to mention the numerous typos in the press notes for media audience that came away noticeably less than impressed myself included nand with good reason somehow some way the supremely disappointing _54_ has made the historically hip haven of hedonism nboring nalthough christopher has distanced himself from the finished film he still must shoulder some of the blame for _54_ lifelessness n_54_ focuses for the most part on tight knit trio of employees at the club coat check girl aspiring disco diva anita wasted hayek her busboy husband greg breckin meyer and most prominently the fresh from jersey shane shea phillippe who enjoys quick rise from busboy to head bartender nthese characters are about as generic as those descriptions nin focusing on the hired help christopher really missed the boat nwith the exception of the flamboyant always woozy rubell myers in well modulated turn the meaty stories to be told at studio 54 are not the workers but those of the people who went there to party not necessarily the numerous vip guests but the wild eccentrics who managed to be picked from the crowd by the club famously hard ass doormen and dance among other things the night away with the rich famous and infamous the only taste of the crowd comes by way of ellen dow feisty dottie disco and drug crazed granny but she a peripheral character at best nas such aside from the expected overhead crowd shots there is precious little actual _dancing_ in _54_ nwhat is disco film especially one about the pinnacle of the movement without the dancing neven whit stillman _the_last_days_of_disco_ which wasn so much concerned with disco as it was witty dialogue within group of hip to only themselves club hopping preppies featured at least one extended dance scene ndancing isn the only thing glazed over in _54_ so is the sex but that may not be entirely christopher fault nfrom what ve heard his original vision was something considerably more dark and daring starting with the shane character he was conceived and actually filmed as wild morally ambiguous bisexual which would have made an efficient springboard to cover the pansexual pleasure palace aspect of studio 54 legend nbut somewhere between principal photography and the final cut shane was defanged and quite literally straightened out consequently so was the film naside from brief glimpse of erotic encounters toward the beginning of the film shane fleeting dalliance with seductive socialite billie sela ward and an abbreviated bedhopping montage the sexual dimension is just about ignored nshane in this incarnation is sanitized to the point of blandness an idealistic do gooder who pines for frequent guest at the club julie black campbell worldly soap star with yes heart of gold nthis tacked on romance would have been slightly less tedious if either campbell or phillippe made some connection with each other or the audience nthey fail on both counts nultimately _54_ failure comes down to three letters u nas in there isn any to be had for the audience ntoo much time is spent with the boring shane and too little is spent on the club floor where all the action took place nanyhow though whatever time is spent on the 54 floor is not used very effectively nwhen anita finally gets her big break and perform onstage at the club it should be euphoric height for her the crowd and the audience however the moment doesn get chance to reach that level for it is cut short by moment of forced sentimentality which also mars the film conclusion one of the last minute reshoots nstrangely upbeat and wistful the resolution is wholly unconvincing and unsatisfying nthere is an interesting portrait of studio 54 out there two of them in fact but _54_ is not one of them nthey re on cable tv couple of documentaries produced by and vh1 nthese two

              " 'mpaa not rated though feel it would likely be pg for martial arts violence nwith three movies already re released theatrically in america and at least three more on their way jackie chan is one of the newest hot properties in action adventure stardom and it just about time nfor over twenty five years jackie been starring in martial arts and action movies in hong kong thrilling audiences with both an incredible grasp of acrobatics and martial arts and wonderful sense of comedy drunken master has the distinction of being the first jackie chan movie to make it big this is the movie that supposedly set jackie up for big stardom in hong kong ni not entirely sure why exactly nin many ways drunken master is similar to most of jackie other early films such as fearless hyena and ii master with cracked fingers half loaf of kung fu spiritual kung fu and others nin fact looking at all these early films together one gets the impression that they were stamped out cookie cutter style at rate of four to six per year all using the same casts and telling very similar stories nto be honest think that early jackie chan movies are something of an acquired taste nthey re quite different from action movies as we know them in america nthese films tend to be set in the chinese countryside in an indeterminate period sometime in the distant past with fairly slow plots that often meander far afield and sometimes seem to exist only for the intention of stringing comedy and fight scenes together drunken master though its plot is tighter than some is no exception as an aside drunken master was the first jackie chan movie ever saw and saw it the way it was meant to be seen in na movie theater in seattle as part of an asian film festival nat the time didn really think it was anything special but nafter having seen more films like it it kind of grown on me drunken master storyline is very similar to that of other early jackie chan movies such as fearless hyena and ii and master with cracked fingers slacker martial arts student is taught the martial arts by harsh seeming master and has big fight with an evil bad guy in the end formula that has been adapted to put it kindly by american films such as karate kid nmore specifically jackie chan plays the part of wong fei hong aka naughty panther fun loving practical joking kung fu student who is too good at kung fu for his own good but not _quite_ good enough nafter embarrassing his instructor assistant by beating him roundly then beating up bully in marketplace wong fei hong tries to hit on pretty girl but discovers that she and her mother can hit back better than he can and nis further chagrinned to discover that the two women are his cousin and aunt respectively nhis father wong kei ying is unhappy about this and is further annoyed when the father and brother of the bully show up to sue for damages nkei ying soon institutes harsh regimen of punishment which fei hong does not like at all nwhile escaping from this punishment fei hong meets up with drunken old man who proceeds to thrash him soundly then take him on as student and thrash him some more nthis turns out to be su hua chi legendary master of drunken style kung fu nhe assigns fei hong series of bizarre tasks such as filling jugs with water while hanging upside down from frame cracking walnuts with his hands and other such exercises that seem like more pointless cruelty but are actually strengthening him up nthen when he ready he teaches him the seven styles of drunken kung fu nunfortunately the lazy fei hong only practices six of them drunken master features some wonderful martial arts sequences with jackie winning some fights and losing others nit been said before but ll say it again these fights don just _happen_ they re as carefully choreographed as any ballet performance and it shows nin his fights jackie often makes use of objects found in his environment benches jugs cups bowls fruits and vegetables often in new and surprising ways nthe fight scenes particularly those toward the end of the film are unparallelled in most american films nwhether jackie wins or loses it really something to see and nit often as funny as anything too nand funny is the other thing jackie chan is very very good at nthere very little that new in this movie jackie winning fights jackie getting beaten badly by master jackie going through punishment or training these nschticks have all been seen before in any one of several dozen similar jackie movies from the seventies and early eighties nbut they re still hilarious as ever nlikewise jackie has _great_ supporting cast many of whom were also in other early jackie films and they re often the source of plenty of hilarity on their own nthe really big thing about drunken master though that inspired several copycats including couple starring jackie himself and sequel fifteen years later was the drunken style kung fu ni not certain whether or not this is actually genuine style of kung fu but the principle behind it is to imitate the wobbly movements of drunkard to lull the enemy into false sense of security and nit apparently helps if you re drunk while you re doing it ngenuine or not have to admit there just something incredibly fun about watching fellow who looks utterly sloshed wading into group of startled opponents and making mincemeat out of them before they even realize what going on ncome to think of it perhaps this element is what accounts for this film success over any of the other jackie films it nnot just martial arts it the kind of martial arts that makes you stop and go whoa non the negative side the cinematography in this film is nothing special the film stock is rather primitive the plot is often rather slow and the subtitles are sometimes extremely hard to read against the background gone with the wind this isn nstill if you like martial arts films or like what you ve seen so far of jackie chan and want to see more give it shot nit much more real than chuck norris or jean claude van damme nyou might very well like it nanother interesting thing about drunken master has to do with its video availability in the us drunken master is the only early jackie chan movie that know of that you can find in its original letterboxed hong kong subtitled form commercially available on vhs from magnum video in gold box for about 10 nthere are plenty of other early jackie films around but these are typically either in dubbed pan and scanned form or else import tapes priced for rental instead of purchase nthankfully drunken master at least is available in the aspect ratio in which it was meant to be seen at very affordable price nif you like drunken master take look at the numerous other early jackie chan films that are out there even the dubbed ones aren really _too_ bad if nnothing else you can enjoy the martial arts choreography while making fun of the dialogue ni particularly recommend spiritual kung fu half loaf of kung fu the fearless hyena movies and snake crane arts of shaolin nalso the mostly unrelated storywise sequel drunken master ii will hit theaters in american release sometime later this year though what its american release title will be is still uncertain and comes _highly_ recommended by this reviewer nalso for rather different interpretation of the character wong fei hong who is in fact popular figure from chinese folklore ve been told to suggest the once upon time in china series starring jet li though haven personally seen any of them yet nif you choose to watch drunken master really hope you enjoy it and hope it starts to open your eyes to the wonderful world of asian cinema that out there nall in all give this film an ',\n",

              " 'if there is one thing that bothers me about hollywood films it their predictable endings nthe devil advocate has the atypical hollywood ending when everything that should happen does nunfortunately for the devil advocate this ending nearly collapses in on itself and ruins the entire film nnevertheless the film does provide two and half hours of pure entertainment note to self kill whomever was in charge of the previews for this film ni don think was quite prepared for this movie because the trailers made it appear to be some supernatural horror film about satan nwell it does contain this element but what is not mentioned in the ads is the other plot elements and seemingly more interesting ones at that nthe devil advocate begins in florida with an ongoing trial in session nkevin lomax keanu reeves is the defense attorney working for client whom has been accused of raping young girl nhe ends up with not guilty verdict despite an emotional testimony from the victim heather matarazzo nhe leaves the courthouse with his lovely wife mary ann charlize theron where he is approached with an offer to travel to new york city to help choose good jury nhe accepts mainly after seeing the paycheck he will receive and he flies to new york with his wife nafter proving his worth for selecting juries and his perfect winning streak in court the head of the firm john milton al pacino asks him to work permanently as criminal lawyer nhe graciously accepts where he is treated almost as god nhe is given an incredible apartment which is bigger than my entire house now and hefty paycheck nhis life seems to be on the rise nand of course his life suddenly begins to waver and slowly decline nhe is attracted to fellow employee christabella connie nielson and his wife begins to feel very lonely in her large apartment nmary ann takes up friendship with neighbor who always gives advice especially if it is not wanted nmeanwhile kevin nabs case surrounding alexander cullen craig nelson who apparently murdered three people nhe spends hours upon hours with this case while forgetting his loving wife who may or may not be going insane nall of this while john milton may or may not be the devil himself nafter while things turn completely upside down as kevin wife claims to have seen monstrous images superimposed on her friends na fellow employee is murdered in the park and his mother judith ivey reveals information about kevin real father nis it all just big nightmare nor is john milton really satan playing tricks with kevin life nthe devil advocate plays out fairly straight forward but for some odd reason the screenwriters wanted to surprise everyone by giving us something we don expect nis this surprise conclusion supposed to make us feel good and go home without feeling depressed or disturbed nif so the devil advocate messes up completely and ironically felt more depressed because of the ending as is now than would have if it had ended ten minutes early ni went into the devil advocate expecting shocking horror film and that is exactly what got ni was settled in to be disturbed mentally and emotionally and that is what got nbut what was the most disturbing and horrible aspect of the movie is the poor ending did mention that didn like the ending nthe producers of this film take you on thrilling roller coaster ride and just as it is ending they pull the rug out from under you nfilms like se7en and the usual suspects can survive with this surprise ending because it is expected more or less nwe know it is going to end in an unpredictable way nthe devil advocate on the other hand ends unpredictably not from us knowing lot but knowing nothing at all nif that is confusing recommend watching the film and then reading that again nas for the film overall enjoyed the entire first two hours being drawn in by terrific character study and then adding the supernatural plot to increase the tension build from the character study nthe film runs like well built clock slowly building until finally exploding with highly charged climax and an unpredictable one at that nand then you settle in for nice resolution which does not occur nit was at this point that felt cheated ntaking us on terror ride of intrigue we follow kevin lomax around as he is the centerpiece of the film neverything occurs from his perspective nhe is our representation on screen sort of nbut we are forced to witness conclusion which makes most of the film seem like game ni don want to spoil the ending so all can say is go see the film and decide for yourself nperhaps the most shocking thing about the devil advocate is the extreme amount of everything nit earned its rating for reason nthere is plenty of nudity sex violence gore and then you have gore violence sex and more nudity nthis film really isn subtle about anything showing us everything nit actually surprises me that this film did not receive an nc 17 rating as it is quite harsh nhowever the movie does have its merits and nudity and sex are among those ni don condone sex and nudity in films but if its there might as well enjoy it nthe biggest merit of this film is also the most interesting to watch nthe confrontations between kevin lomax and john milton are entertaining but what stands out amidst this extreme hatred is the decline of the wife mary ann nportrayed by the extremely effective charlize theron mary ann problems are incredibly intense and found myself wanting to witness her decline nthis may sound uncaring but wanted to watch because felt sorry for her nshe is the most interesting character on the screen who is forced into world where she is not wanted nsomething the devil advocate contained actually shocked me for reasons other than extreme violence and nudity especially for film of this nature nthe story actually has something to say about humanity nin one of the last scenes john milton explains to kevin lomax the game god plays with his children he is satan of course nhe comments that it is human nature to lust and loathe in vanity nthen god sets up rules which contradict human nature nthis semi religious bashing is more humorous than frightening nwhat milton says is so true about our society that found myself laughing out loud partially thinking it was funny but patially realizing it was true nthese moral dilemmas are present throughout the devil advocate giving it an added depth many films skip over in their writing but m sure they came straight from the novel it was based on nwhen film has something to say about our society it deserves to be watched nthe cast of the devil advocate is one of the highlights as we see memorable faces and they put spins on those memorable faces we don expect nheather matarazzo makes brief appearance as the terrorized victim in the opening court case and she does great job nprobably the big surprise of this film is keanu reeves nhe has proven himself an uneven actor successes such as speed and bombs such as johnny mnemonic but he tops himself with this performance ni have never seen him more believable to date nal pacino is of course the scene stealer nhis devilish performance is equal to those of jack nicholson the witches of eastwick and max von sydow needful things nhe could have easily gone too far over the top in many scenes but he remains completely believable if that is the correct term njeffrey jones mostly known as the principal in ferris bueller day off also gives good performance as eddie barzoon njudith ivey manages credible performance as the mother who holds secret to kevin past nconnie nielson is very effective in her role and she also appears naked several times none familiar face with twist was coach star craig nelson who gives very good performance nthe devil advocate is rated for sexuality nudity violence language and some gore nat 144 minutes this film moves along fairly quickly nfor the first two hours sat completely engaged in the good performances and strong characters nthe technical quality is also remarkable with great special effects and good musical score ndirector taylor hackford has managed to create very disturbing motion picture only to ruin good chunk of tension with the final fifteen minutes ni guess my biggest problem with the ending is the fact that went into the theater expecting disturbing film and hackford gave me just that for long time nbut just before the end he got jitterish and relied on the hollywood safety net in order to make his film more mainstream npersonally would have preferred it ending fifteen minutes early ',\n",

director jim jarmusch writer jim jarmusch nrating good shot stars nlanguid yet pointed and focused ghost dog the way of the samurai sublimely savages our cultural fascination with the mafia and the sleek ultra cool cinematic image of the hitman njuxtaposing the samurai honor code of feudal japan against the tradition bound modus operandi of the american italian mafia it ceaselessly chips away with sculptor precision at the archaic foundations of both as they lumber dinosaur like to function in the modern era ndirector jarmusch gleefully plays the iconoclast ripping into mafioso precepts with splashes of acidic wit nusing palate of bleached colors jarmusch lugubriously maintains tone of desolation that belies the many sparks of laugh out loud humor punctuating the film nhe doesn cater to audience expectations of hyper colorized stylized violence and gunplay where no one dies nthe action is presented in flat brutal codas nbullets have permanence ndeath has consequences nthe movie rises beyond standard conventions to become meditation on the concepts of honor and loyalty nit is an anti movie of sorts nthere are few photogenic empathetic characters for the audience to fall in love with nthis isn a film that lovingly holds your hand nthere are dark contemplative moments and the film firmly holds you by the shoulder just so asserting itself for all to see nthe fulcrum for the movie thematic balancing act is ghost dog mafia hitman na twist on the stereotypical image of the mob enforcer ghost dog is hilarious contradiction in terms nunlike the sleek muscular killing machines one is accustomed to we are given an inner city black man who is overweight and slovenly replete with chapped dirty hands and rumpled clothing nhe wears hooded sweatshirt which he often pulls over his head giving him monk like appearance nthere are no acrobatic back flips and shiny super guns in his arsenal nhe uses old worn weapons and simply goes about his tasks in economical efficient and pleasureless fashion nghost dog is disciple of the old ways of the samurai distilling the essence of his life through the filter of book which he reads daily hagakure the way of the samurai nlife consists of simple pleasures for him ice cream warm rooftop naps and good books nghost dog lives as it were by the basic tenet expressed by his book one should start each day considering oneself as dead nliving atop an abandoned building surrounded by his flock of pet carrier pigeons ghost dog exists in netherworld lacking creature comforts and friends nhe craves nothing more nas he puts it late in the film ve seen all want to see nhe exists in spiritual world of the mind gaining moral sustenance from his readings nghost dog wasn always as he is presented nin several roshomon like flashbacks it shown how ghost dog was assaulted by racist white males and beaten nearly to death until the timely intervention of good samaritan that samaritan being foot soldier in an aging crime family nghost dog pledges his life to the service of the man louie tormey as repayment nafter years of loyal service ghost dog is sent by louie to kill handsome frank made man within louie organization who has run away with the crime boss daughter louise vessey nghost dog wordlessly executes his task witnessed by louise whom he spares as she sits watching betty boop cartoon clutching copy of the book roshomon nin bit of synchronicity louise loans the book to ghost dog nupset that frank was taken out by someone not from the family the mob bosses in turn put out hit on ghost dog in perverse twist of loyalty to their assassinated comrade nthe rest of movie holds the dated value systems of both the mafia and ghost dog up to the light of new millennium with many acerbic asides as the two come factions come into conflict nthe theme of old cartoons flares up time and again each time showing cartoon violence that is in sharp counterpoint to the reality of ghost dog world neach time character is shown watching cartoon it from the same era betty boop felix the cat etc reflection of days gone by nnear the end louise is watching cartoon that a departure from the previously shown ones nit a bit of audacity on jarmusch part that is nicely effective despite it surrealistic nature nas ghost dog floats through his world his life is touched by two people none is sage little girl winbush who connects with ghost dog through their love of reading nshe comes to symbolize melding of the old ways and new sensibilities just as louise ultimately does nby film end the fact that jamusch is so effective at illustrating the tenuous bond between the two is testament to his skill as writer nthe other person in ghost dog world is an ice cream de bankole vendor who only speaks french yet intuitively shares rapport with ghost dog nthe vendor is the literal stranger in strange land njarmusch through rapper composer rza underscores his film with rap and reggae music which at first blush seems dichotomous but its primal rhythms serve to strengthen the fundamental nature of the movie nghost dog seems to draw some type of strength from the rap music he listens to as he negotiates the streets in various stolen cars which in and of itself presents another paradox about ghost dog sense of honor nthe head mafioso is played by henry silva with stone faced resignation nof all the cartoonish mobsters he is the only one who appears self aware of his state in the world ngorman plays sonny lieutenant who respects the old ways yet has quirky affinity for rap music love comically shown in several impromptu displays nruffini seems the truest reflection of the mafia nhe is husk of man assisted by two hearing aids who barks out advice without truly hearing what he or others are saying nwhitaker carries the film by using what truly great actor use his face nghost dog is reticent to speak often going for long periods without doing so nthe fact that whitaker can convey such wide range of emotion through gesture or look is remarkable talent nalthough the film has deliberate pace some of the late night drives and walks taken by ghost dog dragged the momentum down ntruly tragic is how ghost dog misinterprets japanese honor in his final confrontation with the mob nhe reveals himself to be so desperate for spiritual guidance through the hagakure that he fails to truly adapt it to what is real and true in his world ncarried on the shoulders of remarkable performance by whitaker ghost dog rises beyond being characterization or icon into figure that garners sympathy if not bit of pity ',\n",

              " 'historical epic as genre was almost banished from hollywood in early 1990s nfor many critics scholars and most importantly film producers it was thing of the past something that could have attracted crowds only in the era of black and white television and non cgi special effects nbut in 1995 same as in the case of dances with wolves five years ago there came the man who decided to use of all his energy and talents of actor producer and director in order to revitalise that particular genre nand same as in the case of dances with wolves he was awarded for his effort with oscars nthe name of the film was braveheart and the name of its director and main actor was mel gibson nthe plot chronicles the life of scottish warlord and folk hero william wallace 1272 1305 nin his time english king edward longshanks played by patrick mcgoohan has almost completely subdued entire british isles including scotland whose proud inhabitants are now subjected by ius primae noctis and various other forms of humiliation and oppression by english knights nalthough english had killed his father many years ago young scottish commoner william wallace played by mel gibson doesn care about politics and wants only to have peaceful life with his new bride murron played by catherine maccormack nmurron death changes that and wallace takes arms and together with small but dedicated band of followers begins guerrilla campaign that would systematically destroy almost every english garrison in the country nthrough time more and more people join his ranks and in 1298 wallace rag tag army scores surprising victory against english knights in the battle of stirling bridge nbut the newly won freedom is endangered by the internal squabbles between scots themselves especially nobles under pretender robert the bruce played by angus macfadyen who wouldn like to have simple commoner as national leader nbraveheart was only the second film in the directorial career by mel gibson so it wouldn be fair to compare it to the better known genre classics directed by david lean or anthony mann nhowever even when we apply such criteria braveheart is more than decent historical epic that takes new and refreshing approach to the genre nthe most noticeable element of this approach is naturalism nwhile older hollywood films set in medieval europe used to give fairytale like vision of picturesque castles splendid costumes and knights in shining armour gibson shows us the extremely unpleasant world of poverty and feudal injustice where might made right and life was hard short and brutish nthis general unpleasantness is especially underlined in the scenes of battle where hand to hand combat is naturalistically displayed in all its gory details never seen since verhoeven ultra naturalistic flesh blood ncompared with this naturalistic approach most of old hollywood epics look like stage plays nbraveheart also employs humour at the right places not only to make bloody realities of medieval british isles more bearable to sensitive audiences but also to underline its down to earth atmosphere so different from previous historical epics nwhat makes braveheart larger than life is his protagonist nmel gibson obviously invested plenty of his energy and talent in bringing the mythical figure of william wallace and as result character of 15th century poems is transformed into superhuman being that resembles late 20th century comic book hero nwallace is more than superior to his enemies both physically and mentally yet he is able to show his sensitive more vulnerable side nnaturally when the character is based on epic poems most of historical accuracy is going down the drain which was the case with almost every historical epic from hollywood in 1990s nhowever even those who don particularly care about history or are willing to give poetic license to scriptwriter randall wallace might think that he went over the top in idolising wallace especially in the second part of film when scottish superhero manages to seduce princess isabel played by sophie marceau and make her child nbecause of that the disbelief is hardly suspended and final scenes aren as effective as they should be nmel gibson as an actor is truly wonderful and he is also helped by small army of very good british and irish actors nmost memorable of them all is patrick mcgoohan whose cold calculated and evil medieval monarch is one of the most effective villains seen in contemporary cinema nbrendan gleeson who would later become famous for his role in boorman general is also very good as wallace trusted companion as well as ian bannen is effective as leprosy stricken king john balliol ndavid harra is very entertaining as wallace irish ally and angus macfadyen brings lot of anxiety into his conscience stricken character of robert the bruce nwomen in this film have rather thankless roles especially marceau as one dimensional french princess ncatherine mccormack as wallace wife was more interesting but she was eliminated from the picture early on nfrom the technical point of view the film is also very good nphotography by john toll brings lot of scottish natural beauty to the screen non the other hand the musical score by james horner employs too much of modern day instruments for period piece set in medieval times nalthough mostly welcomed by critics and audiences alike braveheart was often criticised for homophobia and other forms of extreme conservatism nthe main reason for that was the fact that gibson among many historical facts chose to be faithful only to those related to sexual orientation of longshank son prince edward played by peter hanly nhe is not only presented as villain but also as one of the less competent in villain camp and portraying of homosexuals as villains or inferior to heterosexuals is almost unforgivable sin in politically correct hollywood nto make things even more obvious good guys in this film are the total opposite of effeminate and incompetent edward rugged macho men of mountains who are more practical and efficient because they tend to employ conservatives common sense instead of fashionable theories of ivory tower liberals nhowever although the message of this film might look right wing it owes more to leftist ideology of various national liberation movements in 20th century naccording to that ideology oppressed classes workers peasants are better suited to fight for national freedom because their members has less to lose in that struggle and as such they are more radical less willing to make compromises and more efficient on the other hand privileged classes aristocracy bourgeoisie are more likely to betray the cause of freedom and be in cahoots with foreign oppressors in order to keep their privileges nthis marxist worldview is presented in braveheart without any subtlety nin the end whether the audience is patient enough to discover hidden meanings or simply wants to enjoy entertaining historical epic braveheart is more than adequate choice for all fans of this recently resurrected genre ',\n",

and gwen to pretend to be on the road to reconciliation nhe enlists the help of kiki julia roberts gwen sister personal assistant and whipping girl nwhat lee doesn know is that kiki is in love with eddie fact that could temper her effectiveness npress junkets are haven for control freaks nstudios fly journalists in from around the world and put them up in plush hotel with food and drink always at hand ngenerally on the evening of their arrival writers are bussed to see the featured film then ferreted straight back to the hotel nthe next day writers go to the studio suites and assemble in groups of five or six for roundtable interviews nevery 30 minutes or so producer director writer or actor is brought into the room for few minutes of questions with publicist hovering in the corner to keep an eye on things nthe atmosphere is one of cordial oppression writers are free to ask what they want but understand that if the studio dislikes question they may not be invited to future junkets nrepresentatives from tv stations face even more restrictions nthey get roughly five minutes to interview each member of the cast and crew with the studio filming the exchanges nthe reporters are notorious for tossing softball questions as they suck up to the stars but to play it safe the studios stand ready to erase the tapes if anything unpleasant occurs nplacing two spoiled actors in setting where image is everything is inspired but the screenplay undermines the conceit nthe junket is moved from the handsome but highly confining four seasons hotel to plush resort near las vegas nfor most of the film the movie stars run around the sprawling grounds completely safe from the eyes of the press nwhen they do deal with journalists the it is imperative that you be on your best behavior in front of the reporters premise is de clawed ngwen and eddie insult each other while the tv cameras roll they scream at each other in restaurant filled with the media and at the screening of the movie everyone connected with the film goes nuts all without any repercussions nlee certainly isn bothered by any of the infantile outbursts in fact he makes arrangements for footage of even more inappropriate behavior to be delivered to the tabloids nis the studio angry about his handling of the combative actors nhell no they feel lee is genius for garnering so much publicity for the movie nall of which underscores how billy crystal and co writer peter tolan screwed up their own premise the comedy in america sweethearts is based on barely in control people trying to contain themselves in the presence of reporters except that it doesn matter because any publicity is good publicity nand thus the very set up for the film implodes leaving smoke and dust in place of laughter nso what about the cast njulia roberts at her best playing the underdog is utterly charming here although could have lived without flashbacks that exist solely as an excuse to show her in fat suit and not very convincing one by the way ncatherine zeta jones makes believable brat and john cusack fleshes out his obsessed character enough to make him vaguely sympathetic nby casting himself as the publicist billy crystal allows himself to do roughly the same thing he does on comic relief stay on the sidelines of the action while tossing off cornball jokes and snarky remarks nin supporting roles hank azaria wears out his welcome fast with broad gestures and spanish accent that speedy gonzales would have deemed too broad nseth green is amusing as toadie stanley tucci is very good as ruthless studio head and christopher walken plays the eccentric director with suitable flair though he has little to work with ncome to think of it little to work with is the operative phrase for this movie nas hollywood satire america sweethearts is toothless nas romance it is at best minor pleasure nsuch good cast such waste of their efforts nhad it not been taken long ago better title for the film would have been much ado about nothing ',\n",

recall many of the great character actors anyone who can put the name james rebhorn with that actor face is invited to treat themselves to product from one of my sponsors nexample the other day my mother asked me the expert of course if there were any movies out worth seeing never mind that our tastes couldn be more divergent ll never forget the day she recommended that go see night at the roxbury for god sakes and to be fair she was mightily pissed at me for telling her that go nwas lot of fun which it is so didn see this as anything more than futile attempt at conversation ni muttered with little trepidation that she might enjoy high fidelity nshe responded with her usual query whose in that one nthis is question whose answer that seems to immediately conjure up the kind of movie you went to see nif the reply is julia roberts you probably assume it was something wispy and light sylvester stallone movie and you picture bloodbath with few words and much involuntary bicep flexing and woody allen movie means hyper articulate white people usually of the jewish faith fretting about in some upper east side palace nanyway when answered john cusack she replied with rather stunned who as if it was unreasonable for her to know whom was referring to nnow know for fact that my mother has seen several cusack movies most recently being john malkovich and pushing tin but suppose it understandable that she would not recognize the name after all for most names are tougher than faces ni showed her picture of cusack mug in the paper hoping for an oh him yes he quite good instead got no don know him nat this point was way beyond frustration into realm of nose hair yanking anger yes filmic ignorance is all it takes to get me into the nose hair pulling zone till realized something doubt that much of america would recognize cusack relatively bland visage or even the name which is rather bland compared to the coolness of brad pitt or tom cruise one syllable names that glide off the tongue with the velocity of speeding car ncu sack cu sack no not quite as cool ni sure that twenty years from now cusack will forever be referred to as the guy from add in the cusack film of your choice nhe not brand name and his movies usually aren big moneymakers but in his own unassuming way he kind of genius nwith his pleasant common man looks and charming semi articulate blatherings he has become one of the most likeable romantic leading men of the 90 nfrom the sure thing to say anything cusack has merged the talents of early tom hanks and early jack lemmon ndespite the fact that nearly every character he plays is variation of the character before it the schlumpy every man he a constantly enjoyable screen persona like albert brooks or woody allen nand he knows how to chose scripts while the stephan baldwin and val kilmer seem to put them selves in everything the former actually had the insight to follow up oscar winner usual suspects with pauly shore vehicle and judging from his latest projects it looks like he still has yet to fire his agent cusack generally picks rewarding projects save for the unwatchable hot pursuit 1988 film also featuring young ben stiller nhigh fidelity is his second collaboration with hit or miss english director stephan fears the grifters the hi lo country and it a hit nit was also co written by cusack and some of his collaborators on the terrific comedy grosse point blank nit not quite as entertaining or as funny as that film but as it progresses in its meandering fashion the movie cast something of spell over me nhigh fidelity begins as hipster ode to the non committal rob vinyl record store owner who opens the film by breaking down the fourth wall with much abandon and educating us in his top 5 break ups list nthis is something cusack does the entire film la ferris bueller day off nat first the talking directly into the camera schtick had me vaguely annoyed mostly because it reminded me so much of the film body shots which used similar conceit but it began to grow on me due almost entirely to cusack witty delivery nhe the kind of guy we don mind talking directly to us ngradually the film settles into shampoo like tragi comic character study of guy who must confront himself and his personal failures in order to figure out the true person he is yes it all very existential nthough that plot line is mostly enjoyable the thing liked the most about the film is how much pleasure it offers in introducing us to minor characters all of whom now this is really something are terrific enough to warrant their own films nthe best of which is jack black of the very funny show tenacious a program that sadly went the way of bruce willis hair unfortunately that annoying smirk remains an ardent record store employee who bullies customers into buying exactly what he wants them to buy nhe the kind of guy m sure we ve all met before blowhard who thinks he always right and will do anything in his power be it yell argue insult to hoist his opinion onto others nbut like this guy because of how black plays him nthe actor is portly with round baby face and crazy eyes but despite his size he leaps to and fro like manic speed freak which might be bit of redundant description seeing as how all the speed freaks know are manic nhe the kind of supporting character who would be impossibly annoying comic relief in most other films look at what that hack jan de bont did to poor phillip seymour hoffman in twister nbut fears and black never let that happen nthe character for all his shucking and jiving is steeped in reality nhe over the top but in way we can all probably relate to ncatherine zeta jones in her brief role gives vivid portrayal of women completely enamored with her own charm ntim robbins registers in an even tinier part as new age type character played entirely for cartoon yuks but still manages to work its desired comic effect nthe one exception in the acting department is bit of doozy the main love interest played by danish actress iben hjejle mifune who completely obliterates any trace of danish accent replacing it with stilted american phonation ni give her kudos for attempting such contradictory role but instead of being likeable she comes across as rather robotic and as such it hard to see why cusack character would be so obsessed with her especially when he has beautiful intelligent writer natasha gregson wagner potentially waiting in the wings nthis reminded me of say anything where the charming cusack was paired with the charmless ione skye and in midnight in the garden of good and evil where the poor bastard had to put up with alison eastwood whose unbelievably more wooden then father clint for those special people whose wheels turn little slower nin fact cusack is rarely paired up with personality that matches his though d bet that if laura and natasha switched roles the result would be more effective nhigh fidelity works almost entirely on the strength of its characters and performances nfears direction is somewhat stilted and the script is sometimes little too and this is word m beginning to hate to use but alas must quirky for its own good think ll blame that on scott rosenberg who judging from what he did with beautiful girls con air and things to do in denver while your dead has his fingerprints all over the most irritating bits of this movie nbut cusack really does deserve an award for being so damn cusackian ni afraid that his talents are so understated that he may have to wait till his hip needs replacing to be offered such an award worthy of his considerable talent nhis character rob whose sort of like an older more bitter lloyd from say anything is funny and tragic without being pathetic and that cusack can do all this and still not imprint himself onto the minds of most audiences is something of an achievement ',\n",

              " 'logical time travel movies are near impossibility nconsidering that the skeptic best argument against the possibility of time travel is the idea of altered realities writing script that deals with this problem is an imposing task noccasionally we get film that does manage it nterry gilliam 12 monkeys was one such film nbut more frequently we get films that don much deal with it at all nthere is one question to ask in this case does the film have other virtues that override the existing logical inconsistencies nthe terminator films made up for them with exciting action back to the future did it with an entertaining story and the new film frequency pulls off the trick with strong package of its own nis frequency filled with plot holes nyes ndoes it matter nnot really nthe film opens in october of 1969 nfirefighter frank sullivan dennis quaid puts his life on the line every time he suits up for his job then goes home to his loving wife julia elizabeth mitchell and son johnny daniel henson nthe double pronged story flashes forward to 1999 where johnny now jim caviezel is all grown up and working as police detective na strange occurrence the appearance of aurora borealis over new york city allows father and son to communicate through the same ham radio frank used in 69 and that john has found in the present day nthough both are initially skeptical of the idea john eventually takes this opportunity to warn his father against his impending death in warehouse fire and he succeeds in saving frank from certain doom nnow flooded with memories of full life with his father alive john is initially overjoyed until he discovers that the changes to the timeline have been disastrous serial killer that would have died has instead lived to kill seven more women nfrank and john now must work together to set things right with john using the information he has gathered in the future to instruct frank on what to do in the past nthe premise of frequency is unusual and requires getting over one very important mental hurdle to fully accept john and frank are the only ones conscious of how the timeline has been changed as result of their actions nthis isn explained you just have to go with it nwhen frank doesn die in fire john is the only one who remembers it differently while everyone else remembers it the new way nthe concept also runs into problems concerning just how synchronous the two realities 1969 and 1999 are to each other nsometimes frank changing the past results in something happening right away in john world and sometimes john gets the changes ahead of time nnow the filmmakers might have perfectly good explanations for this and could probably come up with something fairly convoluted but nevertheless logical if thought about it hard enough for example the reason john gets advance information of the serial killer murders was because the change had already happened in frank world and john is only witnessing the projection of that change but explanations aren really the point nwhen frequency gets cooking it a riveting little thriller even if it is confusing nwhat matters to film like this is if the plot makes sense in the moment and frequency works as long as it keeps moving nthe film manages to be engaging despite the logical confusion ndirector gregory hoblit and screenwriter toby emmerich structure frequency as good hollywood entertainment establishing decent likable characters making us care for them and setting up goal to be reached and conflict to be resolved ni liked many of the creative touches the split screens allowing us to see how the universe is being affected in both realities and the greater framework of baseball to drive the action forward nit actually uses the 1969 mets orioles world series the one that featured the amazin mets to great effect frank uses john advance knowledge of the series outcome to convince his friends to believe him admittedly this device may only be of interest to baseball fan like myself ni even liked the final scene which features frank and john both fighting the same man simultaneously in different time periods nsome may find this scene blindingly confusing as the reality shifts start coming fast and furious but it does make sense if you think about it and give the script lot of leeway and let face it it a darn cool way to end the film nthere are enough surprises and plot twists in frequency to keep you on your toes and as result the movie avoids growing stagnant nthe other major thing to appreciate about frequency is the handling of the father son relationship nquaid and caviezel carry off their parts easily it a rock solid job from both actors nthe relationship is instantly credible because they find the human truth behind the high concept how would one react to being able to communicate with dead relative or with future descendant nwatching the exchanges between frank and john will give you pretty good idea of how to answer that question nthe credibility of the human relationship is absolutely crucial to the rest of the film if we don believe in the characters we don care about the outcome of the thriller plot nhere we do care because we like the lead actors ni also liked some of the supporting cast members nelizabeth mitchell gets stuck with two thankless roles playing julia the doting wife and mother but still performs admirably nandre braugher late of the television show homicide life on the street gives nice supporting turn as frank best friend and future colleague of john nhe has lovely scene in diner in which he tries to explain the situation to julia while frank world series predictions come true before his very eyes nbraugher strikes the perfect facial expression here simultaneously dismayed and amused nperhaps the only thing didn like about frequency is the overly sentimental coda during which the camera focus goes little too soft and the baseball theme gets carried overboard nbut that only because the film had already earned poignancy without resorting to cheap tactics ni freely acknowledge that frequency may best work as guy movie since it focuses on the very male oriented idea of father son relationships echoes of field of dreams can be easily heard but the underlying concept is universally applicable nwho wouldn want to speak with long dead parent nor see how their children turn out tell me about your life son excuse me while mist up nand don call me sissy ',\n",

lucas the consequences would be even more severe because that film is very special for tens of millions if not hundreds of millions of fans nin any case objectivity is something seldom seen in star wars reviews because undisputed majority of reviewers rate it as one of the best if not the best film of all times nthose who don usually have some difficulties in hiding their artistic snobbery nthe author of this review must also concede his inability to use cold objective standards in reviewing this film nlike so many previous reviewers must note that watched star wars for the first time twenty years ago and that remained enchanted by the experience ever since nperhaps it was childlike fascination with until then unimaginable wonders that happened long time ago in galaxy far away nor perhaps it was the rush felt minutes before the opening shots with my expectations already pumped up by serialised comic books and novelisation had read before nanyway watching of star wars was one of the most important movie going experiences of my life nand it was also unmatched for many years to come because very few movies managed to have such strong impact on me like george lucas epic nstar wars wasn just important movie for me or the millions of fans who probably share the same sentiment nit was the defining moment in the history of modern cinema nuntil than american motion picture industry was in limbo social turmoil in 1960s practically destroyed the old hollywood and new authors filled the void mostly by using hollywood financial and technical resources to create serious personal or artsy movies nas result audience traumatised of dark reality of vietnam and watergate didn want to see the same dark and serious content on the silver screen ngeorge lucas with its science fiction epic was among the first to come into rescue nthe audience responded with unprecedented enthusiasm and huge financial success of the movie later backed by supplement industry of toys books comics role playing games and other merchandise slowly began to change the face of hollywood nserious adult movies with artistic ambitions faded into oblivion and were replaced by industrial products of blockbuster philosophy none of the biggest casualties of that trend was the science fiction movie genre nuntil 1977 science fiction movies were mostly in production domain nin late 1960s bigger budgets for science fiction didn look so strange anymore thanks to the great success of 2001 space odyssey nbut the same success coincided with the surge of pesimism and hollywood science fiction was as bleak as the rest of its production mostly dark dystopic movies nhowever in 1977 star wars showed once and for all that this genre can be inspiration for popular movies even among the audience that usually doesn like it nas result seriousness in cinematic science fiction began fading away although some good dark and cult quality sf and continued to be filmed until early 1980s nafter that science fiction continued to be considered synonym for family entertainment nironically the man responsible for star wars was in its time considered to be member of new hollywood generation of young movie authors who made artsy and personal films in early 1970s ngeorge lucas established himself with the dystopic sf movie thx 1138 and nostalgic drama american graffiti nboth movies were considered personal in its time despite latter one becoming very popular nin sense star wars is an also very personal film and the thorny way to the final production shows that commercial considerations were against it not for it nbut unlike many personal movies of the era its personality was in line with the wishes of the general audience nthe plot set long time ago in galaxy far away begins in time of

band comes to the colourful spaceport of moss eisely where they hire the spaceship owned by rogue pilot han solo harrison ford and his furry sidekick chewbacca peter mayhew ncritics who don like the movie especially those who can forgive lucas for his contribution to the quashing of new hollywood are prone to point the lack of originality non the surface they might be right lucas himself admits that he found lot of inspiration in the lore of old hollywood westerns wwii aviation movies old sf cliffhanger serials of the 1930s and 1940s yet the most obvious element would be akira kurosawa samurai classic the hidden fortress non the other hand those who had spent last two decades studying the movie to death would say that the inspiration for star wars went even further into collective subconscious of western civilisation hinted by some mild tolkien references nthe others would find the author element within the story star wars could be seen as an anti establishment film young long haired easy going nature loving heroes are fighting against old uptight and oppressive forces who use supertechnology in most demonic purposes neven out of its historical or social context star wars is an impressive as strictly technical piece of the seven art ngeorge lucas direction is very good with the clever editing and well paced segments between action and dramatic buildup ncharacters are well drawn and deliver all the necessary ingredients both for the space opera and hollywood blockbuster nwe have coming of age hero damsel in distress somewhat toned down due to the popular feminist trends of the time reluctant helper benevolent mentor diabolical villain and finally comic relief in form of two non human characters nsome of the actors are very good alec guiness in his most famous role to date james earl jones whose voice is enough to cause unease peter cushing as an incarnation of pure evil in human form nunfortunately the same can be said for the main leads among the main trio of mark hamill carrie fisher and harrison ford only the last one had the character three dimensional enough to launch his further acting career nthe thing that looked like the most important segment of star wars phenomena during its initial release was the new level of special effects technology noften comparisons with 2001 space odyssey another ground breaking sf film were citing the sheer number of effects as proof of the lucas superiority over kubrick nhowever the special effects by john dykstra and john stears are indeed impressive even after two decades although 1997 special edition did improve them significantly yet they aren the most remembered trademark of the movie nthat honour should definitely go to the oscar winning soundtrack by john williams whose work on star wars is probably the brightest gem in his brilliant career nnewer generations of viewers might be somewhat deprived of the enchantment that still holds those lucky enough to witness star wars original release nyet even if they are immune to the george lucas magic they should watch this film nevertheless perhaps only to become familiar with something that is essential part of contemporary culture

however would rather cut to the chase n54 is dull perfunctory uninspired and boring nthere is nothing in it not glimpse of depth nor shimmer of intelligence or insight nthere is no electricity in any of the scenes or moment of interest in the story or its subplots nand it underdeveloped and features an array of bland characters played by actors who think they re in this year boogie nights nthey are so wrong nthe picture has been assembled by mark christopher nbased on this film don know how he got job in the business n54 is supposed to be an amazing insight into the world of the dance club of the same name which originated in the 70s and closed down in the 80s ni don know if this film went into production after boogie nights was released but christopher has managed to plagiarize paul thomas anderson brilliant work in every possible way from the framework of the plot down to the style of the cinematography nwhat it lacks is everything that made boogie nights great depth intelligence energy fascinating characters and challenging themes n54 can even measure up to the last days of disco which is flawed but still smart and entertaining nit remarkably bad timing d say to release film this tedious after couple of noteworthy pictures of the same kind ni have exaggerated though there is one interesting character and one terrific performance nthat character is steve rubell played with more perceptiveness by mike myers than this limp production deserves nsteve rubell is the owner of studio 54 and if christopher had focused on him then myers could have forced good film out of this wreck all by himself nalas we are instead guided to endure the trials of young man named shane ryan phillippe going nowhere new jersey teen who gets job in the club thanks to rubell homosexual impulses nit here that he meets his friends the array of uninteresting characters his co worker greg brecklin meyer his wife anita salma hayek and of course the love interest julie black neve campbell nshane is just an innocent young fool in the beginning and he has reasonably sturdy home life some of the scenes with his father border on interesting while heather matarazzo who plays his sister pushes phillippe off the screen nbut he decides to envelop himself in the disco scene and succumb to peer pressure and to drugs nwhy his friends push him into drugs is never really explained but the fact that they are friends is questioned only is superficial ways greg gets really mad at shane because he been elevated to bartender status nthere isn a single conflict that takes center stage except that shane has some kind of unexplored reservation with the business in which he works nmost of the film is dumb and most of the dialogue is inane nthere a scene late in the film in which shane confronts julie black and in the next scene they re arm in arm without bit of development nthen they re kissing in bowling alley nthis is five minutes of material thrown into the picture at the last minute well past the one hour mark and this isn a long film to begin with ncampbell is talented actress but she needs role that gives her little depth nthis one doesn nand phillippe has almost no presence whatsoever this performance pales in comparison to mark whalberg star making role in boogie nights nhe seems dumb and misguided and his voice never changes tone ni guess he was picked for the color of his hair and the shape of his body but he seems pretty lanky to me nhe all wrong for lead role but it doesn help that christopher has forgotten to develop his characters nby the end of 54 shane most notable trait is his stupid fake accent nthe rest of the performances are wasted nhayek is an energetic talented young actress and does almost nothing here nmeyer is endearing but allowed to be no deeper than cardboard nonly myers by sheer force of talent manages to rise above christopher wading pool of script nrubell has been written just as depthless as the rest of the characters but myers is good enough to inject subtleties that help round out the performance nin fact myers is the sole reason to see 54 and all it really does is make you wish that the film had revolved around him ni ve read that studio 54 has been recreated down to the last detail nfrankly don care nit easy to recreate something technical like this na fairly skilled production designer and few carpenters can manage such task nbesides christopher keeps the lights so low that the sets are invisible anyway naside from myers performance 54 is complete failure nit dull perfunctory uninspired and boring nsome may find my comparisons to boogie nights unfair but they re so obvious to me nin any event 54 is pallid without the contrast nit doesn even work as mindless entertainment it so shallow that the most escapist viewers are likely to dismiss it nso don forget those key words dull perfunctory uninspired and boring neverything else said was just padding ',\n",

              " 'there is striking scene early in city of angels where all the angels who live unseen in our midst gather at the beach to watch the sun rise nthe camera moves above them showing the endless rows of ethereal men and women all garbed in black nthen the camera moves in on the face of seth an angel played by nicolas cage and as the sun rises he smiles and his entire face lights up nyou see the angels can hear music in sunrises and sunsets but they cannot feel human touch nit is an important scene for several reasons nfirst of all it is one of many instances in the film that make angels seem thoroughly plausible nthe film presents these fantastic beings as normal looking people who drift amongst the inhabitants of earth watching what goes on with little interference nthere are none of the standard hokey angel references used in recent films like angels in the outfield 1994 or michael 1996 nthe angels here are stark and believable nthis early scene on the beach is also an important scene of juxtaposition for its shows how god angels can enjoy aspects of the earth that human cannot and yet they are denied so many simple human pleasures like feeling the sand on their feet or the waves lapping at their legs or the smell of the salt in the air nthere is an inherent tragedy in being an angel although there is much beauty in it as well nthey eternally walk the earth listening to our thoughts touching us in our pain and leading the dying to heaven nlike human existence being an angel is often confused and unsure city of angels is essentially love story between seth and human beautiful but sad heart surgeon named maggie meg ryan nhe first sees her when he is in her operating room waiting to lead the soul of her dying patient to heaven nmaggie is distraught doing everything in her power to stop the man from dying on her table and seth is moved by her efforts and more importantly her overwhelming sadness when the patient dies nangels have the limited power to soothe humans in time of misery and pain and seth does what he can with his invisible touch but it not enough nhe wants to be with her and share her pain not just stand back at distance nhe learns that the only way to fulfill his desire for human love and touch is for him to fall and become human nhe learns this from another fallen angel played by dennis franz y d nblue in touching and humorous performance nsitting at diner together franz tells cage character about how wonderful it is to be human to be able to taste food feel another person skin smell the air and most importantly have loving wife and children nof course there is pain to go along with all this but for seth it will be worth it city of angels is something of reinterpretation of wim wender haunting 1988 film wings of desire nwenders film was more like poem it was the feeling the emotion that truly mattered over what actually happened nthe americanized version moves the location from divided berlin to broken los angeles and the emphasis shifts onto the relationship between the immortal angel and the mortal human nand unlike most foreign films that are re made into hollywood fare it doesn suffer extensive damage nthis may be because director brad silberling casper and screenwriter dana stevens blink wanted to make city of angels its own movie inspired by wings of desire but not an attempt to copy it nand yet city of angels is not typical hollywood movie nit is beautifully filmed in lush colors by cinematographer john seale the english patient whose sweeping aerial shots and golden lighting make los angeles into an almost unrecognizable new world nseale creates many striking visuals in addition to the beach scene there is wonderful sequence in circular library where all the angels appear at banisters all around looking down at seth as he watches maggie walk by nwhile the film travels along charted plot it takes time to develop its characters and situations it sheds light on the boundaries between what is earthly and what is heavenly and shows just how thin those boundaries are nboth cage and ryan give soulful soft spoken performances nryan who is usually so bouncy and energetic truly embodies sadness that can only be alleviated by heavenly touch ncage projects all his desire and longing to be human in simple heartfelt gazes and speaks with the comforting knowing voice that only an angel could have nwhat is most striking about city of angels is that stevens has added new ending to the screenplay which is both unexpected and challenging nit not formulaic hollywood ending because it is both sad and uplifting at the same time nit doesn give the audience what it thinks it wants at the end of romance ninstead it offers something much better something that speaks to the depths of what it means to be human and alive n____________________________________________ visit charlie don surf nan eclectic collection of film reviews by james

              " 'capsule the much anticipated re adaptation of the pierre boulle novel comes to the screen as dark and little dreary film with lots of chases and fighting but very little intelligence nvisually there is much to like about this version but the approach is to take an adventure after the style of gulliver travels and treat it as an action film nthat makes it film without much center 0 4 to 4 npierre boulle author of the bridge on the river kwai wrote planet of the apes k monkey planet the novel as social satire nit reads lot like fifth book of gulliver travels nhumans discover planet in which the roles of apes and humans have been reversed not unlike the roles of horses and humans on jonathan swift island of the houyhnhnms nthe novel moves somewhat slowly to create some suspense in revealing all the things most film fans know to be true about the nature of the planet nit seems to me there is also statement about human cruelty to animals but perhaps was just looking for that nwhen rod serling adapted the novel into film released in 1968 he added number of serling touches familiar from episodes of the twilight zone and changed the ending to make it more serling ish nthe final irony of the original version has become film history nwithout it there could never have been planet of the apes film series ni can surmise only that serling ran into serious script problems in how to handle the tricky question of language nin the book the apes had their own language and the human eventually learned that language nthat could have been done in the film but that would have required the entire film to be subtitled for the non ape speaking nserling avoided this by having the apes speak english and of course there is some justification for that by the end of the film njustifying why the apes spoke english may have even been the inspiration for his surprise ending nbut serling never tackles the all important question of why supposedly intelligent human never shows any curiosity or even surprise that the apes speak his own language language they had no opportunity to ever hear nfew viewers questioned this serious plot hole however and the film has become well respected in cinema history npartial credit at least should go to jerry goldsmith whose extremely inventive score is one of goldsmith best if not his best nwhen the film success called for sequels the filmmakers turned up the violence and they added well intentioned though not very subtle political messages about what was happening in the united states of the 1960s and 1970s nwhile the first film had little shooting of guns and what was there seemed little half hearted by the second film beneath the planet of the apes there was good deal more violence and from that point on the series had lot of violence and chases nthe series concluded with battle for the planet of the apes in 1973 nnow director tim burton tries his hand at adapting the original book again nfor those who thought that the 1968 version was not very faithful to the book burton new version is even less faithful nfirst he does not really reverse the roles of the humans and the apes nhe has them both be intelligent articulate races battling for dominance of the planet currently in the hands uh make that paws of the apes nthat could be good story too but it is not planet of the apes nas with the mission impossible films and so many other cinematic homages to the third quarter of the last century the title makes promises that the filmmakers have no intention of honoring nin 2029 leo davidson mark wahlberg not this world most expressive actor works on space station increasing the intelligence and usefulness of apes nthen convenient time storm sweeps him up wizard of oz fashion and drops him on an alien planet yes he survives this storm but then no storm is perfect nhe quickly finds not greatly to any surprise he shows that on this planet apes rule and humans drool but everybody talks nand the language they talk is earth english napparently it does not even occur to leo that there is mystery that needs to be explained about that nthe fact it does not occur to leo and apparently didn occur to tim burton either is the heart of the real horror of this film nboth just assumed that if apes were going to talk the language they would speak would be english nin any case having one talking race dominating another makes this not look at human animal relationships and more one of the master slave relationships noutside of sudan and few other countries this is less relevant topic nleo is captured to be used as slave but also is discovered by ari played by helena bonham carter nari is an attractive ape with close ties to high political power nshe is bent on making the world better place nperhaps in previous draft of the script she was called hil ari nin any case with makeup that stifles her usual pout carter is just about as attractive as she has ever been in film nshe may want to consider this to become her standard look from this point forward nit is not long before leo escapes with some human and only couple of sympathetic apes nthis is further abandonment of the source material nthe chase severely limits the interplay of ape and human and the examination of each place in this reversed society each important in the book nwe cannot see how the society works because most of the screentime society has broken down nwe see the humans either separated from the apes or fighting them nburton chooses visceral thrills over cerebral ones at almost every turn nthis is miscalculation as characters so lacking in empathy value are difficult ones to place much emotional investment in nthey are basically chess pieces and the viewer has little reason to root for them to win nthe 1968 script had little subtlety with lines like never met an ape didn like but at least we cared for what happened to taylor the main character nmost of what this film has to offer is in the visuals nthe visual work is spotty but generally nicely done except that so much of the film takes place in the night or in fog nthis tends to limit close looks at the makeup nin general it seems much improved from 1968 nthe makeup team is led by rick baker instead of john chambers who did it for the 1968 version nin 1968 chambers makeup was jaw dropper nit was realistic enough to almost be believable but flexible enough to show emotion nchambers is good but if anyone had chance to best him it would have to be baker ntoday audiences have higher expectations baker visualization is really an improvement nthese visuals work nicely nwhat does not work is the wire assisted leaps some of the apes make nthey look like they were inspired by the physics defying leaps of crouching tiger hidden dragon napes spring incredible distances nsome of the best scenes are apes running into battle looking like they have ape posture but when they start flying through the air the effect is lost none final visual problem is that the film frequently shows its budget in what should be spectacular battle scenes the camera shows us only small group of people close up nsince the days of lon chaney and boris karloff few actors have crossed over to stardom in role that required heavy make up nthe one actor who has shot is paul giamatti nit is not that his lines are so good most are silly jokes nbut he delivers them very well nhe was always watchable actor but has not yet made stardom nas the ape trader limbo he over emotes to overcome his ape make up but does it very well nin doing so he makes himself the most interesting thing on the screen nhe is probably the best thing in the film and conjures up memories of peter ustinov performance in spartacus nas an in joke there are several lines in the script borrowed from the 1968 film and an old ape played by charleton heston becomes an allusion to the first film by itself ndanny elfman score has nice primitive feel but jerry goldsmith 1968 tour de force score is real classic nthat score and the whole film will be remembered when the 2001 film is forgotten ni rate the remake 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and 0 on the 4 to 4 scale ',\n",

comes along that can mix humor and romance effectively into the warring races nin essence this is the science fiction equivolence of pulp fiction nthe easiest way to write review of this film would be to compare it to other science fiction films and may have to nstarship troopers is not quite an original film persay but director paul verhoeven gives the film kick the aliens asses style nid4 had this same style except it was forced most likely the cause of will smith having major role nthis new star wars has very simple basic plot mankind vs an alien species nthe alien species in question here is the bugs seemingly advanced civilization of arachnid type insects nhowever the underlying morals of starship troopers are fleshed out with deadly accuracy nsometimes the morals are buried by the bloody violence and intense action scenes but during quiet moments we realize that starship troopers has something to tell us about our civilization nmore than likely these morals will be overpowered and quickly forgotten by the time the movie ends nand they should be ni doubt verhoeven intended this film to be thought provoking film nthis is an event film but surprisingly above average nit is extremely refreshing to watch sci fi war film and actually root for the human side something independence day never achieved nstarship troopers begins with satirical portrayal of those strange join the army ads nmixing web based interface these summations of events are refreshingly original nstating would you like to know more nthese short news bulletins give the film an immediate sense of humor and we know we should not take it seriously nhowever we also witness the murder of several troopers in battle in gory yet funny way nafter witnessing the slaughter the film jumps back one year to setup what we just saw nwe are introduced to johnny rico casper van dien and carmen ibanez denise richards nrico flirts with carmen by sending her messages over computer terminals in school classrooms nhowever carmen isn as interested in rico as she is in becoming pilot nhowever another classmate dizzy flores dina meyer has her eye on rico nunfortunately rico isn interested in dizzy nthis setup is rather cliched as is the result of the setup but it still is fun to watch ncarmen signs up to become starship trooper and as result rico signs up nand as result dizzy signs up neveryone is assigned certain position in the academy carmen gets the pilot position she wanted carl jenkins neil patrick harris psychic gets position in the training program and rico is left in the lowest class of the starship troopers the mobile infantry nthe main story follows rico through his trials and relationships nin reality found myself watching space version of melrose place but with better special effects nan hour into the film the war begins na sense of tension grew in the audience watched this film with nthe first hour may have been funny sometimes unintentionally setup but we grew to care for the flat characters because no matter how hard tried not to like the characters their gorgeous looks won me over call me superficial if you must nfollowing the training sessions which had many dramas in themselves too many to mention here the troopers are sent to war nthe bugs live on the planet klendathu planet which consists of dirt and rock and pretty much nothing else nmany dramas occur during the war until finally the troopers realize that their is something behind the bugs attacks na sort of intelligence which masterminds the defense nthe troopers are ordered to locate the brain and capture it ni hopefully left the plot as vague as possible because starship troopers is not about plot nit about special effects and gory violence ndirector verhoeven most known for his nudie film showgirls and basic instinct returns to his sci fi days which gave us good films like total recall nverhoeven likes to push the envelope of the mpaa but despite all the violence the comic book feel gives the film sense of falsehood nstarship troopers is extremely violent with more gore than this year event horizon nthe rating is well deserved and hopefully parents will not allow their 12 year old children to see it nmy guess is that verhoeven target audience is the 18 to 25 male group nthe film has testosterone level off the charts with chiseled men and beautiful women ndespite these superficial elements starship troopers also creates world which made star wars so successful nwhile watching the film we never second guess the character decisions because they seem perfectly clear nthankfully no hero is punching aliens in the face which gives the flat characters some depth for which we can identify with nthe cast of starship troopers is quite annoying to begin with but they soon grow on you ncasper van dien has the chiseled facial features and tan skin which will make most girls swoon nto most guys he will come across as artificial nfortunately van dien is the worst of the cast despite how hard he tries to come off as real character ndina meyer does much better job of fleshing out her character nher dizzy is extremely likeable ndenise richards also does good job and her scenes are very well done njake busey gary busey son gives wonderfully funny performance and provides one of the biggest laughs of the film nneil patrick harris remember he was doogie howser is little wooden and slightly out of place with the rest of the cast nhowever he does give good performance nmichael ironside gives the best performance of the film as the teacher with one arm nhis performance rises above the rest nperhaps it is because his character is the most developed but think it is just ironside presence on screen nunfortunately no particular cast member gives star making performance which is too bad because the material here could have made many of the cast members stars ndirector verhoeven is the main star of the film nhis direction is fast and unrelentless nhe never slows down his pace which makes for wild ride nwriter edward neumeier adapted the screenplay from the book by robert heinlein nthe writing is usually very funny and sometimes very corny nthe dialogue is smart but not too smart nwe aren required to know everything but some plot holes are left unanswered nthankfully we are not intended to notice and we really don except for one which lingered in my mind for quite while namazingly with all the wars and romance going on the screenplay manages to include some surprising governmental issues nin fact these governmental changes seem fairly plausible and this adds another layer to the story nthe moral debate of the characters is quite surprising to find in film of this genre but what is even more surprising is the amount of humor included into all the carnage ni haven laughed this loud even in some comedies noh and the special effects are first rate nstarship troopers is rated for graphic sci fi violence and gore and for some language and nudity nbelieve me when say this don take young kids to see this film nit is extremely violent nin fact it is probably the most violent film out this year nhowever if you are old enough over 17 to see it starship troopers is guaranteed to entertain nit been long time since have cheered for the heros while also cheering for the bad guys nand still it is my dream to see sci fi film in which the alien race destroys mankind and take over the world nnow that would be entertaining ',\n",
              " 'm an avid fan of the alien saga so this review is obviously tad biased at least admitted it nof course that doesn mean that m gonna be giving this four star review or something because alien resurrection the fourth film in the cool as hell series is not an absolutely amazing film much like the first two were nhowever it a very good film which never fails to entertain and consists of yet another mutation in the style of the series nin short had good time alien resurrection leaves off 200 years after the last one where our heroine protagonist ellen ripley sigourney weaver the science fiction genre answer to job had killed herself after discovering that an alien was inside her body waiting to pop out like it did to john hurt in the first one nof course the last one wasn very great or anything liked it though not as much as the first two and more importantly it wasn financially successful tawdry 55 million bucks nso back we are with ripley back as clone which means we get another little satirical look at cloning not that that a bad thing but it becoming cliche nso she cloned aboard an even more futuristic looking ship called the auriga by some doctors including the necessary bad government guy dr wren played by e freeman as well as the little seen dr gediman played by none other than brad douriff mainly because they have version of her with the alien still inside her nonce you get past the fact that you can figure out where they got her blood although think it might have been from the blood samples taken by charles dance in the third one the film okay nalso on board are band of mercenary pirates including michael wincott ron perlman kim flowers raymond cruz dominique pinon jeunet sytable and winona ryder who plays analee call who turns out to have bit of secret won state it but unless you ve been shacking up with salinger for the past two years you probably know all about it although it nicely covered up nthere a bit of non sexual yet slightly homoerotic relationship between her and ripley but it never really deepened enough noh well nwell as you might have guessed the alien and its spawn escape and run around the ship nand it pretty much does away with most of the people on the ship including some shocks dan hedaya for instance who death is comical yet sad since well he dan hedaya and the remaining people about 7 or 8 are left to try and escape and stop the aliens from doing any major harm since the ship is heading quickly towards earth nof course the plot is all balderdash and just an excuse for some good old alien brand fun nthe real focus of the series seems to be on style not really substance although there always bit of it most notably in aliens with the relationship between ripley and the little girl nwhat interesting about the series is that each film is stylistically different in its approach alien is claustrophobic exercise in quiet frights aliens is wild tense thriller alien 3 is bleak moody piece of semi noir alien 4 is kind of like an off beat french film filled with lots of humor and cool scares njean pierre jeunet without his usual directing partner marc caro creates ship filled with the kind of scares films like das boot has with echoes hinting at possible threat nthe chills in the film are really cool especially with the music which is sometimes turned down completely for certain scenes there the most tense surgery scene since face off towards the beginning nand not every chill turns into bloody mess or anything like that nthis all combined with some good old humor makes this as interesting visually and stylistically as the others nthere are even couple scenes which just stick out afterwards as being brilliantly executed none is the aforementioned surgery scene nanother one takes place between call and ripley which is just awesome nthe underwater chase scene and the ladder scene afterwards is one of the most tense thrilling and jaw dropping scenes in the entire saga with small allusion to jeunet earlier film delicatessen nand the way they do in the final alien is hysterically cool with lovely allusion to goldfinger nbut the best scene in the entire film m sure m not the first to mention it takes place when ripley sees all the variations on her as they cloned her she has an 8 tatooed on her arm nit might be the most emotionally stimulating scene in the entire saga nthe screenplay by joss whedon is not great piece of work as it never really deapens lot of the characters nhowever it does make us care about most of them so that when there very little of them and it looks like one or more of them may become alien chow we are pretty scared nand yeah there are some very funny lines ripley who do have to fuck to get off this boat njohner well can get you off nbut not this ship nthe acting is good all around with stand out performances from ron perlman as the male chauvenist pig johner and leland orser the poor bastad in se7en who performed the lust sin as an anxiety ridden wannabe woody allen who has an alien inside him nwinona ryder is good but not amazing like she usually is although she meshes well with the film nof course and as usual sigourney weaver steals the show nplaying variation on the ripley character less emotional and more rude and bitter she pulls it off while still being utterly lovable nshe not going to get an oscar nomination like she did for aliens but she just awesome noverall it a thrilling entertaining film which doesn really amaze like the first two but is much more amazing than the third installment nthe style is the best part of the film which isn really bad thing but it being the best part takes away from lot of the depth the film occasionally tries to apply nbut it entertaining as hell and it definitely fit for the alien series ',\n",

              " 'set in the late 80 at the height of yuppie excess and based on the book by bret easton ellis who explored the same themes in another book which was also made into movie less than zero american psycho puts new spin on the yuppie genre that ellis helped to create nchristian bale is perfectly cast as patrick bateman high powered yuppie who hides terrible secret from his fianc and his colleagues nit seems that bateman is serial killer and unfortunately for his contemporaries his tenuous grasp on reality is starting to slip nas he tries to balance his meticulous daily routines with slaughtering co workers and prostitutes and hiding their bodies his mental fabric slowly begins to unravel ni was first introduced to the novel when was still in high school ni read an associated press article in our local sunday newspaper detailing the problems ellis was having getting his novel published due to the controversial violence in it nas usual when anything is controversial try to seek it out but soon forgot about the novel and didn end up thinking about it again until stumbled across it couple of years later at bookstore ni picked it up and read it but was ultimately disappointed because it left more questions than answers nthe movie has similar effect but at least it less cryptic than ellis novel nfor once film has actually turned out to be better than the novel it was based on nboth the book and the film open with bateman describing his fastidious morning preparations down to exactly what facial scrubs and exfoliating creams he uses but the novel seems to concentrate more on these excesses throughout nthe movie continues to touch upon these things but makes more of point to immerse us in bateman impending madness than to detail things as painstakingly as the novel does nas result the film is immensely more entertaining nlions gate seems to be the studio champion of controversial films having picked up kevin smith catholic rattling dogma and here with american psycho there is no difference nscreenwriters mary harron and guinevere turner had the unenviable task of trying to take novel about yuppies filled with graphic violence and sex and make marketable film out of it nsome cuts had to be made to the finished film to keep from getting an nc 17 mainly involving sex scene comprising bateman and two women and initial reports said the film was unwatchable nthankfully it is watchable and harron and turner have made one of the most scathingly satirical films this side of south park bigger longer uncut nside note 1 co writer guinevere turner also makes an appearance in the film as an ill fated acquaintance of bateman who after bateman suggests that she start making out with female prostitute proclaims that she not lesbian nor has any interest in it nthe ironic humor of the scene stems from the fact that turner the writer director of the film go fish and who also assisted kevin smith with parts of his script for chasing amy is lesbian nit a subtle in joke and it one found to be pretty humorous ndespite having rather high profile supporting cast of young up and comers including reese witherspoon most of the roles are waste and are the equivalent of extended billed cameos nthe real draw here is christian bale and his over the top performance as patrick bateman nwhenever read novel always try to imagine what it would be like as movie and who would be perfect to cast as the characters ni always had hard time trying to decide who would cast as bateman but never thought bale would deliver performance as perfect as his ends up being nto say bale runs away with the character is vast understatement and he proves that he as adept at chewing scenery as al pacino or rod steiger none sequence in particular involving bateman describing his love for huey lewis and the news song hip to be square right before burying an axe in co worker head features one of the most eccentric and kinetic performances have ever seen on film nside note 2 despite the fact that huey lewis hip to be square and pair of phil collins songs appear in the film don expect to see them on the soundtrack release nhuey lewis expressly requested that his song featured in rather large set piece in the film much akin to the use of stuck in the middle with you in reservoir dogs not be included on any soundtrack release ni assuming that collins requested the same non similar note whitney houston cover of the greatest love of all is also involved in scene comparable to the other two and it is very obvious that it isn the houston version at all but merely an instrumental version culled from an unknown source napparently houston wasn as open about the use of her song as the others were na bigger controversy than the violence and sex has been brewing since the film release that of whether or not patrick has actually committed the crimes we have viewed during the course of the film ndon look to the book for any answers because it will only serve to confuse you more nseveral web sites have been dedicated to the subject but m still undecided nthere is evidence both for and against but the most scathing evidence against comes from scene near the end of the film where bateman goes on killing spree taking out cops old ladies and cleaning staff with equal gusto nthe scene seemed very dream like and as absurd as the action films it suddenly seems to be parodying as an example bateman blows up police car very cinematically after firing several shots from handgun in the general direction of the car ni kept waiting for bateman to wake up and for the film to continue on from there but bateman never does wake up and the whole sequence though comic throws the film off balance which suppose was the intention nother than the few flaws have mentioned american psycho is an incredibly entertaining film although you may not leave the movie fully understanding whether or not what has just transpired actually occurred in bateman reality ni think this movie is destined for greatness as cult film and deserves the spot it will take as such nit may not change anyone life but it will certainly have an effect ni know will certainly hear hip to be square in different context the next time hear it r ',\n",

clarify don love just any cop movie m not too keen on the smug buddy cop flicks that were so in vogue in the 80 and now slowly gulp returning thanks to jackie chan and chris tucker ni partial to those gritty earthy cop dramas like serpico donnie brasco and the french connection nproblem is these films come along just about as often as george bush makes cogent point so whenever true cop movie does hit multiplexes come running towards it like an eager puppy and inevitably leave head bowed tripping over my squiggly tail nso what is it about cop movies that transform me into moron willing to shell

criminals lurk and cops like modern day knights must shield us from their iniquitous clutches nyes it all very corny and awfully boys clubish which m guessing is precisely where these feelings come from nas little tots us boys are brought up to create our own wars with gi joe enact cops and robbers or cowboy and indian fantasies etc the best gritty cop films tap into those gleeful adolescent fantasies and heighten them turning it all into an existential nightmare of thin moral lines and psychological chaos nas an adult my tastes haven changed all that drastically sure can get cerebral high from the emotional complexities of krzysztof kieslowski film but still delight at the promise guy film could potentially bring nnow what if it the cops who re the corrupt ones nooh that one

to the level that brad pitt currently resides at nsince was hatched mere two years prior to the release of prince of the city cannot provide an answer as to why it didn n though judging from his recent roles in tripe like deep rising and dead heat would guess that it probably has something to do with quite few bad career moves nlike mickey rourke and eric roberts both of whom are currently doing time in direct to video purgatory williams is talented leading man who didn make it to where he should have if there was any justice in this dog gone world keanu reeves would be the one banished

who take down drug dealers on the gritty pre juliani streets of new york nthey work without uniforms or hours much like paid vigilantes nand that analogy is more than apt seeing as how the bunch are kinda sorta forced into using corrupt means to get the job done nthe squad relies entirely on informants low level junkies to gain access to the big wigs and in order to obtain the info they seek they sometimes have to provide the junkies with the junk of their choice ndanny has done this and though he a fairly honorable guy who took the job in order to do good his intentions have gotten bit skewed along the way nhe seeks redemption and concludes that the best way to go about getting it is by talking to internal affairs who then convince him to go undercover as double agent nhe does so with one condition he will not rat on his partners nright away we know that that is exactly what he ll have to do nand watching the movie build to that is thrilling in the way that any great character driven story can be nundercover cop films are almost innately exciting even the kind that pull out all the cliches like in too deep nhow can one not be moved by the issues of betrayal ambiguity and the danger in putting oneself in such risky position nprince of the city takes all this and charges it with perceptive hard boiled script and taut unintrusive direction by old pro sidney lumet as well as handful of intense performances most notably by treat nlumet greatest contribution to the movie is how he lays back and lets the camera soak up the action nhis scenes transition rapidly from one to the next building layers of tension and he rarely holds for reaction shots instead he clicks away at precisely the moment character stops yakking nlumet worst tendency is one that many film makers especially oliver stone tend to overuse he relies little too heavily on actors shouting their lines at each other presumably in order to ratchet up the tension nthis isn as much problem here as it was in night falls on manhattan lumet most recent cop lawyer endeavor movie that nearly gave me an ulcer from just watching nthough of late lumet has made several really awful career choices maybe he and treat should get together for drink or something the most recent completely unnecessary remake of gloria here he was on sustaining tension in film that runs for 167 minutes with not one dull spot nsome of the formula pictures like the best are the most simplistic nhollywood often forgets how easy it is to make these kinds of pictures even tolerable nof course cop movies aren popular anymore yes buddy cop flicks are popular but those are more like extended sitcoms with gunfire amid the punch lines but just look at the average hollywood action movies flicks so bloated and full of unnecessary fat like the boring love interest that serves no purpose other than to stall the action and demonstrate that our hero isn gay the lame comic relief character who never funny and on and on nfor all its moral ambiguities prince of the city is back to the basics cop courtroom drama that leaves out all the crap and really thrills nit focuses completely on its story and its characters all of whom are completely believable from the cops to the lawyers to the junkies nthere a great scene early on where an irate williams shouts at an ia officer and looks as if he about to go into one of those corny braveheart inspirational speeches but instead he breaks down in front of the cop and begins sobbing nthis is scene that would never make it into michael bay film even though bruce willis sacrifices his life at the end of armageddon not one damn tear it would be cut out because the director would say oh that makes him too human excuse me weak nin the very next scene danny speaks in hushed raspiness straining to get the words out nhe lost his voice ndoes that little itty bitty detail matter nmaybe not to most but it sure made my night nand in sprawling epic of corruption greed betrayal and violence it nice to see that someone is paying attention to the little things ',\n",

note that warning clouds loomed on the horizon for the project well before warner bros made the contentious decision to abandon preview press screenings and scrapped plans for gala premiere nthis highly anticipated film rendition of the cult television show was originally slotted for an early june opening where it would have gone head to head against the rival studios heavy hitters its eventual demotion to less potent mid august opening was an obvious early indication of the studio lack of confidence with the picture nand with good reason nthis is joyless exercise of film held together by barely coherent plot and lacking any semblance of excitement thrills or wit nremarkable in its banality and brutally uninvolving the avengers is catastrophic mess which immediately invites comparisons to last year case study in style over substance joel schumacher much loathed batman robin indeed both films even feature appalling ridiculous sequences which find central characters dressed up in fuzzy oversized costumes numa thurman who takes on the salacious role of the catsuit clad karate chopping emma peel immortalized by diana rigg was the only bright spot in the aforementioned schumacher disaster imbuing her poison ivy with dose of sassiness and sly wit that gave audiences something to smile at amidst the cinematic carnage nunfortunately the same can be said here where she and cohort ralph fiennes our new john steed taking over for patrick macnee demonstrate no appreciable chemistry whatsoever fatally crippling the picture as they volley fizzling repartee back and forth and trade double entendres with all the enthusiasm of two actors painfully aware that they re on board sinking ship nat this rate usually splendid actor mr fiennes may never make the transition from arthouse apollo to mainstream leading man his tepid turn here will make as much of an inroad as his commendably seedy performance in the regrettably neglected kathyrn bigelow film strange days nthe duo look the part and admittedly the avengers is more than most heavily dependent upon style but they re no fun to watch and found myself growing increasingly distant and annoyed by the lack of spark between the two cheekily ironic characters as they navigated through the picture caper esque plot nwhen not checking my wristwatch or shifting restlessly in my seat began to alleviate the boredom by considering how this all might have played out had the filmmakers chose to go instead with that erstwhile emma as our mrs peel no not kate beckinsale although the notion now intrigues me but gwyneth paltrow who was originally in the running for the part and can veritably handle spot on english accent nif nothing else it at least be highly entertaining for the incongruous sight of the vaguely twiggish young actress kicking butt nthe story such as it is involves the ever bemused tandem of steed and peel combating the malevolent sir august de wynter sean connery an eccentric aristocrat threatening the safety of the nation with his climate controlling contraption they also sip lot of tea noverlooking some goofy cloning nonsense and quirky hijinx involving our protagonists superiors it sounds far better than it plays and is rendered almost indecipherable by blatant post production tinkering it clearly evident that the picture has been cut to shreds nthe avengers was never about gripping drama and our heroes accordingly never take villainous sir august very seriously but given the lack of cohesion in the plot and the lack of menace conveyed by the buffoonish maniac it all decidedly uncompelling nmr connery who onscreen barely long enough to register an impression approaches the role like man fulfilling contractual obligation simultaneously chewing the scenery while unable to hide his disinterest nat least it all looks good nthis is genuinely handsome production with fine costume design by anthony powell and crisply shot by roger pratt nin particular the gleaming production design by stuart craig commands attention adeptly drawing elements both old and new in order to depict this great britain nthere are handful of striking visual moments in the film including an attack by swarm of giant robotic bees and nice shot of steed and peel finding way to walk on water but the film is so unremittingly dull that even these instances fail to stir interest or raise pulse rates nby the time the film climax had arrived my interest was not with the sight of steed and sir august slugging it out amidst crashing waves and thundering rain but with the quickest escape route from the theatre nnot coincidentally the enticing bits of visual bravura were the shots assembled into the movie remarkable trailer savvy piece of work which ironically is infinitely more appealing that the feature film itself the first promo which made the rounds in early spring is probably my favourite studio trailer so far this year nit everything that the avengers is not saucy clever engaging and entertaining na crushing disappointment the film is one of the worst outings of the year too drearily awful to be savoured as gleefully bad too polished to overlook its deficiencies nthere may be upcoming pictures that are even more lifeless than the avengers but sure hope not ',\n",

mike bitten again by the bug slides down that slippery slope risking his relationship education and reputation as playing poker again becomes the focus of his life nto make film about gambling filmmaker will usually have to play up the glamorous side to get the audience behind the characters nthis is because few moviegoers will care whole lot about some guy in leisure suit or terry cloth shirt sitting at folding card table with stogie in his mouth nrounders however seems to go more for the latter than the former nthe card clubs mike and worm frequent aren very glamorous at all nthere a basement lodge with elk heads on the wall goulash joint these are the kinds of locales in which director john dahl sets his shots nexcept for one brief instance when the two players visit atlantic city the film is bereft of the flashing lights of the casinos or the pleasant color of the green felt table nthe reason rounders still captures our attention is because it is less about the game of poker than it is about the personalities which enjoy and are slaves to it nwe re given nice set of interesting characters with clear motivations and good actors to play them nmatt damon is very natural as mike who struggles between his desire to play the straight and narrow by finishing law school and answering what may be his true calling playing professional poker ned norton worm is truly worm always looking for the angle and playing everyone for what they re worth njohn turturro who amazes me with his acting range tones it down in this film by playing joey knish virtual poker prodigy in his time who now plays the underground games to make rent and child support payments nhe both friend and mentor to mike and turturro low key performance is totally convincing just as john malkovich heavily accented teddy kgb is imposing as an adversarial dragon mike must slay to prove himself nmartin landau is also thrown into the mix as one of mike law professors abe petrovsky nwhile landau slips well into the role his character spitting out personal anecdotes about staying true to one self facilitates the channeling of the storyline toward predictable ending nperhaps the weak link in the otherwise formidable line up of acting talent however is gretchen mol who just didn seem to have much presence on screen nshe a genuine peach to look at kind of cross between actress renee zellweger and singer jewel and wouldn be surprised if the three of them formed some kind of blond haired triumvirate and attempted to take over the world but her delivered lines seemed very flat and found myself looking for matt damon reactions instead na good thing about rounders is that it doesn get bogged down in the character development and statement making so much that it can find time for humor nthe film is peppered nicely with scenes that both make you laugh and keep the pacing going such as sequence where mike and worm move rapidly around new york from one game to the next in widely different locales none game in cigar club had me in stitches i love the sweetness of this dark maduro wrapper says one of the players clearly more interested in displaying his pretentiousness over the cigar in one hand than in the cards in his other ni was hoping mike and worm would really take these guys nwith all the poker being played rounders had the potential to be very confusing nyou might think you know lot about poker but think again nluckily we re given narration by damon during the more intricate moments to explain what going on nthe narrations are more informative than intrusive and apprise us of what the stakes are and why certain players want to do the things they do nit nice that as the characters develop so does our comprehension of their world nas film about success and survival in the realm of underground poker rounders delivers in spades nwait nas film about the culture of cards rounders is an ace nhang on npacked with great acting and great characters rounders is

make it different from other routine government conspiracy action flicks could be dropped from the beginning and the movie would turn out exactly the same if not better nthis central device is the fact that nine year old boy is autistic nhis name is simon and an evil government bureaucrat named nicholas kudrow alec baldwin wants him dead because he unknowingly cracked supersecret government code slipped into the back of puzzle magazine by its programmers just to see if someone could beat it nsimon is intended to be the heart and soul of the film and we are supposed to feel for him because he is poor handicapped child thrown into violent unfair world against his will with only renegade fbi agent played by bruce willis to protect him nthe fact that he is autistic does nothing for the emotional intensity or the plot necessities of mercury rising ni suppose the original novel upon which the movie was based did much more with this aspect of simon character and his relationship with willis but here it is lost nmiko hughes the young actor who plays simon goes through the prescribed motions of being autistic he walks slowly drawls his words kicks and screams when he touched and has hard time looking at other people nit a difficult role for an adult much less young child to play and unfortunately hughes never convinces us that he isn playing like he autistic nunlike dustin hoffman performance in rain man or leonardo dicaprio in what eating gilbert grape we are always painfully aware that hughes is acting nhowever unlike rain man which used its character autism in unique and interesting ways to build credible and touching story mercury rising could go right about its generic predictable plot with simon being simply really smart but really shy kid nhell he doesn even have to be shy nin fact the movie might have been more interesting if he had had more active role rather than just being carted around under willis arm nwillis character art jeffries is disillusioned fbi agent who has been removed from undercover work and is now doing menial tasks like listening to wiretaps with rookies who are happy to be doing anything nhe becomes involved with simon when he is called to check out murder scene at simon house where his father has apparently shot his mother in the back and then committed suicide nof course we know that isn the way it happened happen because we saw an evil square jawed government hitman with mean looking crew cut knock off the parents nsimon was able to get away and jeffries finds him hiding in secret compartment in closet which the rest of the chicago police department had overlooked njeffries who is accused by several characters at different times of being paranoid although his actions never suggest it knows there is something more and he makes it his personal mission to go against everything and everyone in order to protect simon nthis is quite task because that same hitman who knocked off simon parents is crawling everywhere attempting to kill simon at the hospital on the highway and every other place he goes nlate in the movie jeffries is forced to enlist the aid of pretty young woman named stacey kim dickens who he meets at coffee shop nof all the hard to believe aspects of the movie this is the worst ni can believe in the decency of the human heart but stacey character is far too accommodating nnot only does she agree to watch simon while jeffries runs off to solve the mystery she lets him into her apartment at two clock in the morning when she knows the police is after him and then lets him leave simon in her apartment which means that she has to forgo business trip that is desperately needed to pay the rent nthe grinding squeals of the rusty plot machine are almost overbearing at this point nthe movie might have been redeemed by some good action sequences but even here mercury rising doesn rise to the challenge nthe movie was directed by harold becker who has made some good suspense films including sea of love 1989 and malice 1993 but his talent is nowhere to be found in this latest excursion nthere is one fight on streetcar between jeffries and another hitman played by peter stormare that is so ineptly directed shot and edited that had no idea 1 exactly where they were on the streetcar 2 who was hitting who and 3 where this hitman came from and how he knew where jeffries and simon were nthe grand finale takes place on the roof of tall building and features harrowing yawn scene where simon walks along the very edge of the building not because he has to but because it more suspenseful that way ntaken as whole mercury rising is an tepid confused movie that lacks style wit and any traces of sense of humor nusually willis brings his personal brand of understated humor to his roles but here he is too straight and serious nthis is because the movie wants to be an action flick and heartfelt drama at the same time but it ends up failing on both fronts nmaybe the book was better but the way it handled here is perfect case study in formula filmmaking guaranteed to bore ',\n",

bad things are about to happen to mr pitt nand indeed they do after hideously prolonged sequence where pitt looks over his shoulder at the retreating forlani and forlani looks over her shoulder at the retreating pitt because pitt walks into the road without looking and suddenly gets squished nwell when that happened the audience howled with laughter and continued to laugh at every comment that was remotely humorous nso if you think that sudden violent death and sarcastic drawing room humor are funny encourage you to go see meet joe black immediately nanyway the deceased lawyer body no worse the wear from its massive injuries is possessed by the angel of death and brad pitt takes over that role nthe idea is that death given the pen name of joe black so as not to disturb others wants to take holiday and experience the world nif this weren hollywood we might get an interesting metaphysical discussion of life and death but since it is we get scene after scene of fish out of water humor just as if death is george of the jungle or crocodile dundee or some other poor schmuck who wandered in from the jungle or the outback or whatever and doesn know how to act in our society nit also doesn help that the character of death is written so inconsistently nhe claims to be on vacation but he never does anything except hang around the seriously attractive claire forlani just try to get your travel agent to book that one nhe speaks very slow and halting english but perfectly fluent jamaican patois nhe knows everything about some characters nothing about others nand as played by brad pitt he not especially menacing or charming or glamorous or intriguing he just there nit as if someone told pitt never mind about acting in this picture son just stand there and look pretty nit as if pitt is doing his keanu reeves impression throughout the movie ni ve used the phrase angel of death in this review very deliberately to contrast pitt performance with this year best angel performance nicolas cage in city of angels nwhere pitt is cold and unfeeling cage is as warm and empathetic as the situation allows nwhere cage is genuinely curious about the nature of man pitt is aloof and arrogant ncage struck instant chemical sparks with co star meg ryan where the chemistry between pitt and forlani is only understandable if you accept the notion that forlani character is so shallow that she can see beyond pitt good looks nthe movie other top name is much better actor but that doesn save meet joe black nsir anthony hopkins isn given much better material to work with unfortunately nhe plays one of these good hearted multimillionaire media moguls that only exist in hollywood one wonders what might have happened if they had made hopkins character more realistically evil nhopkins is marked for death due to bad ticker but death steps in and grants him some extra time in exchange for being his guide in the world nof course no one can be sure of how they will act when death taps on their shoulder nbut have to wonder and in this movie you have very long time to wonder how you or would act in similar situation especially if you or were multimillionaire nhopkins pretty much goes to the office and the major subplot revolves around who will control the corporation nfans of corporate intrigue will be fascinated m sure ni stayed awake all the way through meet joe black and m asking myself why nmovies about death should encourage you to live life to the fullest which is what m going to do now ngo spend time with your family go volunteer for local charity heck go take nap ndon go see meet joe black because all it will do is move you three long hours closer to death curtis edmonds no children have ever meddled with the republican party and lived to tell about it

              " 'when first heard that disney next animated feature was going to be tarzan was almost horrified ni was worried that disney was going to make another hercules sorry jerk ules nthat effort was too overloaded with comedy and the hero was too boastful and pompous to be considered sympathetic hero and after viewing it to this day find it disgrace for disney animation nwhen saw the trailers was thinking hmm nthis isn bad at all nthis just might have potential nwhen bought the soundtrack was really quite surprised at how different it sounded from most disney features ni have never really heard of phil collins nor have heard of mark mancina so was wondering how would these two make this disney flick spin ni was pleasantly surprised the music is top notch nphil collins songs are terrific percussion heavy pieces of work that seem to break the formula for typical disney songs nthe score from mark mancina was also neat it reminded me bit of the lion king but it was more original nso the soundtrack wasn bad at all considering it was by two people am not familiar with nthis film could be good nbut will it be nwhen finally went to see it on opening day as tend to do with most disney animated features my question was answered in complete turnabout of expectations for me disney tarzan is surprisingly decent nthe story starts out with tarzan parents surviving shipwreck and finding home on an island where apes live in peace nhowever one day vicious leopard sabor attacks and kills tarzan parents leaving him at this time baby alone until kala of the apes rescues him nkala wants to raise the child as her own she lost hers previously to sabor but her mate kerchak is not too sure it not our kind he says nhe agrees though to let her take care of little tarzan but that doesn make him my son ntarzan grows up vowing to be the best ape ever but no matter how hard he tries or what he does at the guidance of his hilarious ape friend terk he just can convince kerchak that he is one of the apes even when he defeats sabor in battle none day new animal shows up humans nthis is where jane comes into the picture nshe is on an expedition with her father professor porter and despicable hunter clayton searching for gorillas ntarzan rescues her when she is chased by baboons and soon they get to know each other neven though tarzan falls in love with jane this causes things to go wrong nclayton tricks tarzan into taking him jane and porter to see the apes who are convinced that he has betrayed them nworse clayton has plotted to send the gorillas to london for money nwill tarzan find out which family he belongs to and save the apes ni not gonna tell you sorry nyou re gonna have to see for yourself nand see it you should the animation is as always top notch particularly when tarzan goes soaring through the trees read that skateboarding nthe deep canvas computer generated effect adds an authentic feeling to the jungle which tarzan lives in nin fact it seems similar to the computer imagery cel animation combination in rival disney animted films such as fox anastasia and dreamworks prince of egypt ncould it be that disney was actually taking ideas from their rivals nthe casting is fairly good ntony goldwyn is emotionally believeable as tarzan and to my relief the animators have succeeded in not making him another hercules nnicely done and glenn close is wonderful as kala she has beautiful singing voice too by the way nlance henrikson as kerchak somewhat reminds me of robby benson beast voice which makes him all the more ferocious and gripping nminnie driver had me little worried at first as the voice of jane ni thought she had the most annoying voice in the whole film when first saw the trailers but when saw the film didn have problem with her ni take back my insult on driver nit nice to hear nigel hawthorne do another voice for disney animated feature he was fflewdurr flamm in disney most underrated classic the black cauldron he is funny and delightful as professor porter non the villiany side of the voices brian blessed the guy who did boss nass in star wars episode the phantom menace brings pompous and later on vicious voice to the sinister clayton nhe might not be the strongest character in the film he just plain bad guy nothing else but blessed vocal work contributes greatly nbut if there is any voice that think steals the whole show it should be rosie donnell who is hilariously funny as terk nshe also has fiesty attitude m gonna kill ya nshe says more than once ni almost sung along with her during one of the film best moments where the apes make mess of the human camp via song er scatting shoo be doo da be dah ni can see why she wanted to have rock song for the film she a good singer nnot that she was the only funny character in the film though nwayne knight who played stan in space jam gives whimsically funny style to tantor an elephant who is especially worried about stepping into un sanitary water thankfully there is no real sound of flatuence that would have killed the picture nthe songs as said before are decent mostly sung by collins nthis sets new standard for disney animated films because for the first time the characters do not sing ni tolerate musical numbers from characters lot more than some other guys would but found this to be nice change of pace nthe story does have elements of comedy in it but they also load it with strong dramatic touches which makes this film far better than the unbelieveably uninspired hercules nif there is anything disappointing about tarzan it might be the omission of the sync version of trashing the camp from the film ni heard it on the soundtrack and wondered where it was going to be ni was upset that it wasn because had thought of taking few friends of mine who like sync to see tarzan noh well noverall was enthralled with tarzan ni wouldn hold it high the way do with mulan or the hunchback of notre dame my all time favorite disney classics but this film deserves high place among disney greatest achievements ni give nod to disney for following up their spectacular masterpiece mulan with this great animated adaption of egar rice burrough tarzan ',\n",
              " 'cinematically speaking gordon parks original 1971 _shaft_ is not great film na bit slow at times and more than little rough around the edges as it builds to its climactic explosion of violent action this spirited but formulaic yarn that initially brought ernest tidyman black private dick that a sex machine to all the chicks to the big screen hardly qualifies as groundbreaking filmmaking nyet nearly 30 years after its original release and long after the genre it spawned blaxploitation died with that decade the 1971 _shaft_ remains an extremely entertaining watch never having completely escaped pop culture consciousness nthe reason for this is the same one that explains the film connection with moviegoers far beyond the target african american audience the title character of john shaft nwhile the fact that the strong smart virile and superbly suave shaft is black is the primary factor for his historical and cultural significance his broad based appeal stems from an idea that transcends race he is comfortable confident and proud about who he is and anyone who had problem with that could simply kiss his ass nthis fact also explains why john singleton y2g revival of john shaft is as enjoyable as it is nmuch like the film that started the franchise this _shaft_ plot doesn score points in the originality department but the energy level and smooth attitude distinguishes it from standard crime thrillers ncontrary to what has been reported over the past few months this _shaft_ is not remake of the original film but more of sequel spinoff nthe star audiences know and love from the original film and its first two sequels 1972 _shaft s_big_score _ and 1973 _shaft_in_africa_ richard roundtree once again plays john shaft who still runs private investigation firm in new york city nhowever the focus of the film lies on his same named nephew samuel jackson who as the film begins is cop whose take no crap demeanor constantly leaves him at odds with his superiors nwhen privileged young man named walter wade jr christian bale accused of brutal racially motivated murder is allowed to be released on bail disgusted shaft leaves the force and decides to take matters into his own hands as p nbut that easier said than done for also standing in the way of shaft and his way of justice is peoples hernandez jeffrey wright dominican gangster who is hired by walter to rub out waitress diane palmieri toni collette the only eyewitness to his crime npeoples or rather wright is also the big obstacle in jackson way toward commanding this film npeoples is more of an outrageous comic character for most of the running time and wright is insanely funny during these stages nhowever he isn so funny as to make the character come off as goofy and buffoonish and peoples eventual turn to more serious villainy is seamless and believable which probably would not have been the case had he been played by original casting choice john leguizamo who bowed out before filming nit no easy task to steal film from the jackson who is his usual captivating charismatic self here but that exactly what wright does and makes it seem effortless nthen again with such talented ensemble surrounding him it is not too surprising that jackson impressive star turn doesn quite tower over the rest he is strongly complemented not only by wright but all his other co stars nbale has already proven his ability to play an uppity killer in _american_psycho_ so it only follows that his performance as similar less exaggerated character would be spot on ncollette lends the film some convincing and welcome dramatic weight as the frightened conflicted diane nbusta rhymes brings some good laughs as shaft sidekick rasaan nregistering not as strongly but through no fault of their own are vanessa williams as tough narcotics cop carmen vasquez and dismayingly underused roundtree they simply are given little to do in the script credited to richard price singleton and shane salerno jackson also has little to do in sense some throwaway footage during the opening credits aside his shaft doesn even have one sex scene nthat singleton once again proves his ability with actors is an especially good thing since he not really an action director nthis is not to say that he does bad job with the numerous gunfights and the requisite foot and car chases nthey move well as does the film as whole and are reasonably exciting it just that there nothing terribly inventive about them nthese set pieces are functional in the way the script is they work well enough but they re unsurprising and conventional nbut if there anything that _shaft_ movie does well it make the familiar look cool and this _shaft_ keeps that tradition alive nfrom the slick title sequence scored of course to isaac hayes ever infectious oscar winning theme song which singleton wisely sprinkles throughout the film on the film looks great and easily sweeps the viewer into its world with its energetic bravado neven common visual trick such as employing fancy wipes for scene transitions not only feels unforced it feels necessary nstyle doesn exactly make for great film but when it comes to _shaft_ that of little consequence nwhat matters above all else is having good time and the latest _shaft_ should be just the first of many fun rides to be had with this bad mutha shut your mouth ',\n",

animals have been chewed to death recently nwith the help of the local sheriff lou diamond phillips cdc official carlos jacott and scientist bob gunton sheila discovers it is indeed bats who have been genetically altered by gunton character to be more aggressive and omnivorous in order to be used as military weapon ni have to say here that knew exactly what was getting into going into this film nthere not frame of promotional footage have seen for the film that would have led me to believe it was going to be any good nin this respect the film never disappointed me nthis film reaches level that transcends the so bad it good level and borders on the downright insane nthe effects are awful the script is contrived and for most of the feature was laughing at things that were supposed to be taken seriously think ni challenge anyone to sit through the scene where bat stalks baby in crib while another bat terrorizes patron eating at diner with straight face nthankfully the performances are

troopers nthe latter being the only film out of that batch with any actual merit and this one is no exception nwhile one never really gets the impression that meyer character could be bat expert in reality one never really cares to doubt it either nshe gives as good performance as could be expected plus she nice to look at for an hour and half nlou diamond phillips is also serviceable here as the small town sheriff turned eventual hero nalthough when we first meet his character he knows bats are the reason for what going on in town for some reason later on he suddenly becomes amazed to learn that the actual cause of the deaths in town are because of bats nthe only bad performance in the film is that of leon nhe is relegated to the m not sticking around here ncharacter and proceeds to repeat variations of that line for the majority of the film even though he stays nanyone who can immediately tell that bob gunton the bad guy in patch adams and countless other films is going to eventually turn on the gang and side with his creations before his eminent death will probably be surprised but highly doubt it neven if he hadn been the villain in just about every film he ever been in so many obvious hints are given to indicate the devious act that it holds no shock whatsoever nin fact his death is welcome because it finally starts moving the plot towards the finale nif the plot

until dawn to install cooling unit in the bats cave that will kill all of them off by pulling night job resulting in the death of an entire military unit na cavern full of bat feces never ignites when phosphorus flare is lit right in the middle of it nfinally to top it all off this little texas town is showing nosferatu in it single screen theater for reference our town has over million people in it with nearly 150 movie screens and we re lucky to even get kevin smith dogma nthe most laughable part of the movie though comes from the ill conceived bat puppets nwhile the actual bat attack scenes are shot with rapid fire editing making the scenes nearly impossible to comprehend what going on the scenes where bat is called upon to interact with live actor are usually shot more low key ntherefore we the audience get loving close ups of the most unrealistic rubbery bat puppets ever committed to film nbeing able to see the puppeteer arms would be the only things that could have made

nicotine was an additive that cigarette companies put in their products for the specific goal of getting people addicted nthese people had what are known as conspiracy theories ideas about how unseen forces work to deceive and control the public na little imagination goes long way nin richard donner conspiracy theory jerry fletcher mel gibson is new york city cab driver who seems to have conspiracy theory about everything nhis latest that nasa is trying to kill the president by causing an earthquake from the space shuttle might sound outrageous to us but is all in day work for him nhe combs the newspaper looking for tidbits that leave telltale warnings about the goings on behind the scenes and from there jerry draws his conclusions nupstanding citizen that he is he tries to convince alice sutton julia roberts of the justice department that the president must be warned nlucky gal alice who met jerry when he saved her from couple of muggers and has had to listen to his theories during the six months since nwhat she doesn know is that jerry interest in her is far more than well professional nhe goes to great lengths to follow her around and watch her in her own apartment nbut when some secret government types seem to take an interest in jerry ideas and his limited circulation conspiracy theory newsletter he finds himself in danger and in real need of alice help none of the problems with conspiracy theory is that it tries to pass itself off as an action thriller when it seems to have neither whole lot of action nor significant number of thrills npart of this is result of the film slow pace nit takes forever to set up the relationship between jerry and alice and even once that is over with the rest of the film seems to be lot of boredom that every once in while stops to take break for excitement nat over two hours this film could have been significantly condensed and had it running time shortened by twenty minutes to half an hour but even then the action scenes would not be able to save the film ninstead of truly exciting and engaging set pieces we re treated to few of the generic scenes with the requisite black elements black helicopter men in black action suits and body armor black vehicles you know the drill nthey come on down with all kinds of neat gadgets and weapons but for some reason guy with just bunch of theories and some chick with no training somehow manage to elude them every time nbig deal we ve seen it all before nwatching the film wished donner had at least tried to use little imagination but was out of luck nnow when say it took forever to set up the relationship between jerry and alice completely mean what one person is relative to the other and not romantic involvement noh donner and screenwriter brian helgeland would like you to believe that by the end of the movie the two main characters will end up falling hopelessly in love with each other but there seems to be no evidence of that ever occurring nyou see there were more sparks between gibson and danny glover in the lethal weapon movies also directed by donner than between gibson and roberts in conspiracy theory nthe two just don click and when you throw in number of happenings that would cause alice to reject jerry altogether like finding out he been stalking her the subsequent attraction is absolutely forced nthe script in general also seems forced like someone sat helgeland down and forced him to write it then took it and forced it upon us ndialog is undistinguished and rather unmemorable to the point that almost stopped listening neven gibson usual gift for ad lib couldn punch up the film sufficiently to raise my interest although one of jerry theories about oliver stone was mildly amusing nunfortunately much of what discussed in the film is not inherently important to what going on but instead filler that starts out with potential but ends up just being extraneous because it never followed through nfor example jerry professes that man found drowned in his swimming pool was actually murdered by the government in new york subway station nhe even goes so far as to explain that the station was flooded at the time due to water main break hence the water in subway station and that the coroner should check the man lungs for chlorine nthis is convincing enough to alice that she seems to believe him nyou know what happens then nnothing zip nada nno follow up whatsoever so what the significance nokay here another one na couple of well known real life assassins were found to have possessed copies of the d salinger novel the catcher in the rye njerry also has bunch of copies nwhenever he goes into bookstore he has to buy one nleaving out the question of whether or not this makes jerry an assassin we re never given reason to believe why this would make him an assassin nnot when we find out about his salinger collection not when he goes to the bookstore not later on when we get the answer to our first question nthe point becomes totally extraneous noh did mention that patrick stewart is in this film nyeah he plays this government psychiatrist named dr jonas who may or may not be bad guy nthat about it nfor all the presence this usually marvelous actor has he nearly forgettable in conspiracy theory nyou can just lump him in with the supporting players with the exception of cylk cozart who plays agent lowry of the fbi nthis guy was really likable and wish he and his character had gotten more screen time nokay here my theory nthis really started out as great film but some of its jokes were actually true nthe government came in and forced donner to make edits for the sake of national security and this was what was left over ',\n",

              " 'since most movies about slavery shield us from the true horrors of what they re portraying it fitting to say that beloved come as real shock as film nit confusing bizarre and as tough film to watch as any film ve seen all year and that not necessarily because of the three hour running time beloved is challenging to watch filled with tough and powerful poetry that takes us completely off guard and instead of straight forward hollywood ized story about what happened to the slaves after they were freed beloved comes off as cry of anguish from all those who actually lived through what happened or rather toni morrison who wrote the novel upon which this is based beloved tells the story of an ex slave named sethe played by oprah winfrey who lives on large farm in the north with her children nwhen the film opens her house is being terrorized by poltergeist which shakes things up wounds the dog and makes things generally uncomfortable for the family nsethe is proud though and will not move nher sons run away leaving only her and her daughter denver kimberly elise alone with the ghost which is there without any factual explanation na couple years pass and the ghost remains and one day man named paul danny glover another ex slave who knew sethe years ago when they worked on plantation together arrives asking for lodging nhe has been wandering around since he left the plantation and when he enters the house it turns red and becomes incredibly hot nwhen he remarks about what he thinks is evil sethe replies it ain evil nit just sad nsome more time passes and paul has become fervent member of the household and the ghost disappears nbut when they return one day from going out they discover young woman sitting in the house nher name is beloved and as played by thandie newton she has almost zero motor skills nshe stumbles around half grabbing onto things and knocking them over and when she speaks she lets out low guttural sound that eventually turns into baby talk nthey let her into her house and she begins to turn things upside down beloved acts like an incredibly difficult chamber drama paired with ghost story nmost of the scenes consist of people arguing in one claustrophobic low lit room with the occasional flash to the past where we see images of such horror that we thank god for modern day psychoanalysts nsethe and paul have lived through such hellish times that they are forever implanted with the memories of their slavehood on the old plantation which includes such images as sethe being raped by the white plantation hands with her nipples being licked prompting her to cry out to paul when reminiscing about it they took my milk nworst of all was the month after her freedom when she was allowed to live like free person working with other blacks on farm and then seeing that her old plantation owners have arrived to presumedly take her and her children back nshe runs to the barn near by carrying her four children and when her old owners burst in they discover she has murdered one of them and is ready to murder the rest of them if they don leave them alone nwhen she is inquired about this moment by paul in moment halfway through the film she says she doesn regret it nshe killed her daughter so that she would not have to live through the horror she did and she has convinced herself she did the right thing nof course beloved is really her daugher materialized though we aren flat out told that until later on in the film nbeloved represents the pain and suffering the slaves went through and shows how difficult it was for them to deal with their freedom after being tortured for so long nthus beloved becomes sorta redux of the andrei tarkofsky sci fi classic solaris where cosmonaut discovers that his wife who commited suicide years before has materialized when he is orbiting over planet with complex brain system nthat film spoke volumes about humanity and our memories how we are constantly regretting what happened in the past and when if it ever literally came back to haunt us it would control us completely beloved moves along freely without lot of explanation and for the most part this is extremely respectable nthe most interesting films are the ones that don explain everything for us leaving gaps in the characters that we are supposed to fill in with how they act in the present tense nsethe is never fully explained as character but we understand all her actions since she being played by oprah winfrey nit been well over decade since her last major performance in the color purple but judging from these two films ll bet she one of the best actresses working today if nshe was strictly an actress nher talk show which suppose is great entity has prevented her from becoming noteworthy actress and that a shame because she brings so much to this movie nemotion nsadness nstrength nwatching the strong sethe who so afraid of the past that she built rather strong protective coating around herself break down when she discovers who beloved really is is what makes this movie really great nshe makes it real nthat not to say this is perfect film nin fact d wager to say that the fact that it confusing and painful to watch is what prevents this from being the truly great film it is nwhile oprah performance is powerful and easily sympathetic and m dying to see her win at least an oscar nomination this february the structure of the film which doesn show what happened to her children till halfway through the film prevents us from really making cohesive connection to the film nit doesn necessarily move as though they re memories of one particular character and by the end it has lost control over sethe and as she takes to bed we are unable to truly identify with her anymore nbut despite its tediousness perhaps that the point nthe distancing by the end of the film may be just part of the way it has been built from the start since they figure she has crossed over from being identifiable and it needs to get back with reality nand for the most part this film seems like the cry of pain from the slaves that it really wants to be njonathan demme direction is bizarre in nature with the story and he creates the right mood making it tough film to sit through making sure that the audience feels as uncomfortable as the characters nthere more to admire here like the way that the flashbacks pop up freely and without real organization just like they would be in real life and the way that the ending leaves it somewhat open to more pain and suffering but laced with touch of optimism nthe acting not only from winfrey is amazing and anticipate not only she will get an oscar nomination neveryone has been raving about thandie newton performance and how it should be rewarded nhowever it must be noted that out of everyone she had the easiest part nact like baby nthrow things nstumble around nchew food with your mouth open ni do think there another performance worthy of oscar conisderation but it kimberly elise as the daugher who has to stay sensible and sane and has to carry the burden of her mother loss of reality towards the end nit not that newton isn great she as annoying and wacky as the role demands nit just that elise has the tougher job and pulls it off even better ndespite the fact that this film has winfrey written all over it and not that of writer morrison or director demme beloved has still not done well ncosting think around ninety million dollars it has since grossed about twenty two nunfortunately this film is little too intense for viewers even for me and can stand almost anything recently viewed the 2 1 2 hour long epic caligula the worst film have ever seen in my life and did it in mere 2 sittings nalthough respect beloved can say that really enjoyed it ',\n",

jungle and it fits the coens see los angeles as veritable jungle of oddballs and nutcases with the sometimes bewildered dude left to run through it and try to avoid any more trouble usually unsuccessfully nthe film doesn feature quite as many one liners and sight gags as the coens other comedies though there are few hilarious moments of visual humor particularly in the dude dream sequences and acid flashbacks but it more than makes up for it with the sheer fun of watching these strange characters interact nthe film sometimes seems little disjointed as result you get the feeling that the coens have not only set their characters loose in this jungle but are also themselves running crazy through the jungle of their own twisted imaginations but for the most part the characterizations are interesting enough to overcome the shaky plotting and what turns out to be somewhat anticlimactic resolution nthere also noticeable but not too heavy handed thread of social commentary in the big lebowski which incidentally takes place just as the gulf war is about to begin at the beginning we see george bush on television making his this aggression will not stand speech nthe coens take aim at just about every elite a subculture in the book the egotistical wealthy businessman the bums will always lose nshouts the big lebowski at one point the porn industry the overbearing malibu policeman who berates the dude for disturbing their peaceful beach community and so on nby the end we really start to admire the dude who almost certainly harbors the least aggression of anyone in this story his passive resistance emphasis on passive albeit to the elite emerges as something more than just another quirky characterization in film overflowing with quirky characters nhe also turns out to have pretty well functioning brain in his head even if he doesn like to use it very much his sarcasm towards treehorn and the malibu policeman shows that he knows when he getting run around and he does manage to unravel the kidnapping mystery by the end nthe coens certainly poke fun at the dude for his laziness but they don just treat him as fodder for cheap shots either ni think that more than anything is what makes the big lebowski standout comedy it manages to approach characters like the dude and to some extent walter with genuine affection while still acknowledging that they are pretty scatter brained naudience members may find themselves surprised at how much they like the un dynamic duo by the end of the movie given that they seemed like nothing more than the butts of an extended joke at first it good knowin he out there the dude takin it easy posits the narrator towards the end ni dare say that truer words have seldom been spoken ',\n",

millennium james bond adventure with strapping american read unsophisticated hero more willing to drop kick villains than out fox them nsadly as the picture progresses the final product begins to bear closer resemblance to souped up two hour long episode of magyuver nand not particularly good one at that nwhat went wrong nmi2 begins flashily enough that initial flash leading us to believe that it ll soon give way to something of plot but it only gives way to more flash then digresses further into presumably unintentional parody of itself with much slo mo posturing and countless action set pieces wherein bad guys seem to deliberately leap into the way of tom cruise firing gun just so they can die really cool nearly on during car chase between soon to be lovers ethan hunt tom cruise and nyah nordoff hall thandie newton woo works some of his trademark magic nin one hypnotic though completely inexplicable sequence the director slows the action down to languid semi stall as cruise and his stunning opponent stare into one and other eyes with come hither sexuality just as their respective cars smash and spin in accordance coming ever so close to toppling over neighboring cliff nprior to this we see the famed trailer opener of cruise climbing steep mountain sans scaffolding then leaping from one jagged rock formation to another nwhy ni haven the foggiest ni doubt even john woo could provide you with logical reply nwith mi2 woo has become slave to the summer movie machine the one that jettisons logic for gravity defying effects and story for more gravity defying effects nit possible that these spies could be adrenaline junkies climbing mountains and crashing into each other as means to get off though of course this is never explored nthe scenes ve described are really only included to titillate not to give any insight into character ngod forbid nwoo certainly knows how to make each set piece energetic but they remain individual set pieces never connecting to form anything more than splices of beer commercial like visuals nstill in terms of crackerjack eye candy the opening has much to cherish ncruise and newton first meet during vigorous flamenco dance featuring several welcome woo devices the graceful slow mo artistry of synchronized movement juxtaposed against the stage 1 romance of two attractive individuals discovering how attractive the other is nbetween the frantic dancing woo trains his camera on cruise and newton as they make with some sensuous eye contact nthe scene is little over the top in bon jovi music video circa 1988 kind of way yet it has style and something of soul and woo casts bit of spell on us nsure it all smoke and mirrors but we can see that there happens to be talented maestro behind this particular product nthandie and cruise later meet in bathtub in scene that about half as playfully charming as the jennifer lopez george cloony trunk meeting in out of sight nthey flirt and exchange obvious double entendres nnewton bats her eyes flirtatiously ncruise grins little too slyly nthe cruise character ethan hunt has been drastically altered since the first film nhere cruise plays him more as hip sexual dynamo than the square jawed robot he impersonated in part 1 nhe cool and dashing which is precisely the kind of role we want to see cruise in after watching him sleep walk through eyes wide shut which might just be the longest episode of red show diaries ever committed to film and blustered his way through magnolia quite possibly the most overrated performance of the 90 nsadly as the film progresses we see less of cruise initial m the man ncharm and more slo mo close ups of his preening mug nmi2 falls apart on nearly every level during its repetitious third act which is essentially one hour long action sequence that just won stop nthe whole thing commences with an utterly generic gun battle the first gun fight in the film which really should be unheard of in john woo film but alas this particular battle could ve been staged by anyone from renny harlin to joseph merhi of course excepting the symbolic pigeons who seem to find their way into every john woo picture nwe ve all seen guys slide across the floor in slo mo while firing gun in each hand nit isn done any differently here nthe action is pure hard target broken arrow theatrics with nothing to propel it but the apparent need to see tom cruise drop kick face less villains while his hair whips stylishly in the wind nhe cool for sure but he made to be as empty as the movie nthe actor isn used so much for his boyish appeal as for his chiseled looks he smiles narcissistically into the camera at literally any moment be it during gunfight before one or after one nwhen he not beaming away he staring into the lens with cold eyes trying to look mad as hell but woo editing seriously undermines the effort nhe fetishizes cruise angular face with such glee that it turns into naked gun style spoof ni half expected cruise to peel off his facemask and reveal that he really austin powers nin classic woo action moment ethan hunt struts past fiery doorway glaring at the baddies within its frame like pin up boy angel of death nthe gunfight turns into daring escape which turns into reckless mission which turns into motorcycle attack in which bad guys seem to angle directly for cruise to kill them like some kind of mass suicide ritual one dumb bastard even jumps his bike over the gun toting cruise basically inviting our handsome hero to shoot him in mid air which he does nthe lead bad guy played by the appropriately british dougray scott and cruise face off in mentally deficient game of chicken on motorcycles nthough instead of jumping off to the side at the last moment the two grown men leap directly into the other giving each other mid air bear hug only to fly about hundred feet still in bear hug position land on beach below and begin mano mano fist fight that ends with the bad guy pulling so you thought was dead nnot to worry cruise takes care of the problem without even breaking sweat nwhat hero nyou may have noticed that opted not to describe an iota of mi2 plot nmy reasoning is simple m not sure of any good it would do nthe film itself has absolutely no concern with story only with hurtling forth to the next special effect ni wasn kidding when told friend of mine that mi2 has less plot than the average aerosmith video nnobody will go to this for the plot and if they do they ll surely regret it nas summer movies evolve or devolve character and plot have become increasingly whittled down to nearly nothing nin mi the plot seemed to be built around brian de palma that film director stylistic flourishes while in mi2 the plot only serves to give us an intermittent breather from woo non

haven seen turkey of this magnitude in quite while ni kept vacillating however between giving the ex one star for its sheer awfulness and three stars for its campy humor ultimately decided to split

fatal attraction which use this tired storyline but it seems like 10 000 000 000 nthe ex however though following many of the standard cliches of this thriller subgenre differs slightly from the norm in that at least it doesn take itself too seriously like so many other duds do malicious and stalked are two examples which come to mind nthose involved in the movie realize they re in turkey apparently and turn in hammy performances which compliment the ludicrous dialogue contained within the script nthe ex storyline as said incorporates many cliches predominant in films of its nature however the plot is so overwrought and unbelievable that after while the viewer must accept that logic does not operate in the realm of the movie ndiedre david first wife kills and kills and kills for example without ever having to worry about police investigations and the like it not as though she bright enough not to leave fingerprints at the scene of the crime ndavid and his new wife molly have an incredibly difficult time understanding why michael their son has emotional problems specifically his inability to control his anger nthough david smokes like tomorrow will never come and blows up at people every other minute in the movie the connection between him and his son is not made nmolly is easily swayed by diedre into believing she a child psychologist and allows the demented woman to spend time with her son ntime and time again things do not add up in this movie nif viewer can accept this fact then he will definately not like the ex nif on the other hand he can appreciate the movie for its campiness then he ll probably like it much better ni don mean to necessarily suggest however that the ex is memorable exercise in camp neven when viewed from an it so bad it good angle this movie isn all that successful nthe ex does have its moments though almost all of which involve yancy butler the psychotic diedre and nick mancuso david nthese two actors turn in decidedly hammy performances which oftentimes elicit chuckles from the audience nthe truly awful lines written for them help this humor along nbutler gets the larger portion of bad dialogue every time her character kills someone she has punchline that unbelievably inane nwhen she murders tenant of an apartment she wishes to use to spy on david for example diedre whacks the elderly lady with crowbar and states m so sorry your lease is terminated nor how about when diedre takes out her therapist in another ridiculous scene diedre therapist wishes to have her recommitted so she decides to visit diedre alone in her new apartment never realizing of course that it not her ntherapists typically are catatonically brain dead in these movies nhaving successfully snuffed the woman out diedre looks at the body and says what was it that you always said to me at the end of each session dr jones noh that right i sorry but your time is up nthis is what passes for humor in the film nthe audience doesn necessarily laugh but groan the type of groan that suggests the audience can believe they re watching this crap although watching it they are nnick mancuso chainsmoking nervous wreck character does not have the cheesy lines that butler character delivers but his ridiculously overdone performance provides for some better comic relief nin between drags off his cigarette for instance in one of the movie best scenes david tries to explain to his lawyer what creep his ex wife is nin exaggerated exasperation he nearly shouts the woman is cuckoo bird trust me it is funny in context nand so the movie continues

film not so brilliantly observes after discovering diedre has moved into an apartment across from her family to spy upon them that she crazy nyou be pretty crazy too if you rented this turkey ni avoid

              " 'director david fincher has such an eye for detail which is very rare in hollywood these days terry gilliam comes to mind as another one nfilm is one of the best art forms because not only can you tell story but you can use the camera to capture the smallest detail and have it mean something nbut most directors seem to go for action with the slightest ounce of story nso whenever director uses the camera to its fullest potential the film almost automatically deserves good review nand when they add fascinating story to it you have nearly perfect entertainment nfincher the game is no exception to this nthe game is one of the most interesting and complex films to come out of hollywood in long time nfincher hasn made film since seven his box office and critical hit which defied expectations and became one of the best movies ever nso it is about time he made another film nand what ride it is nthe game isn quite as powerful as seven but in some ways it is better noverall the game could have used little more clarity or little more uncertainty nit walks line of insanity and reality but it never goes either way until the very end nthe outcome is satisfying enough for the preceding events and it makes lot of sense once everything is set straight nunfortunately unlike the usual suspects we are never given enough information to figure out for ourselves what is happening whether it be true or false nhowever this also gives the film frightening aspect which the game uses to the fullest extent nthe game is told completely from its main character point of view nnicholas van orton michael douglas is high strung and isolated businessman nhe lives alone in his giant mansion divorced from his wife elizabeth and is celebrating his 48th birthday the same age at which his father committed suicide at in the same mansion nfor his 48th birthday conrad sean penn the rebel of the family gives nicholas gift certificate to crs consumer recreation services it will make your life fun again his brother promises nas skeptical as nicholas is he is somewhat intrigued and annoyed by the lack of information something this businessman hates nseeing billboard in an office he decides to visit the mysterious company njim feingold james rebhorn greets nicholas and guides him through the sign up process which consists of psych tests physicals emotional responses and other mind games each game is suited to each person emotional and psychological needs explains feingold none day nicholas gets call from crs and they explain that he failed the tests neven more intrigued and now somewhat angered at the time he spent signing up he starts asking around to see what people can tell him about the company nwhat he doesn realize is that the game has already begun nthe phone call is just the first of many strange events to be thrown nicholas way nhow he finds out that he is involved has to be witnessed because it is amusing and fun and visually impressive nthe detail involved in fincher shots is incredible and almost requires second viewing just to appreciate the effort that went into them nwith seven fincher had almost every single shot mean something nhe also has the unique ability to make you look at exactly what he wants you to ncompared to seven though the game is light and comical nbecause of this film sense of humor and self awareness nothing can be taken quite seriously nso don try to make much sense of what goes on in the game because it doesn want you to nwhat does make sense is the final revelation when everything becomes apparent and clear nif taken as it is the game ending makes complete sense nbut if you try and critique every minute detail then you get yourself into plot holes and incredibility nperhaps that is the reason docked the film nwhile trying to remain realistic and plausible the plot is too unbelievable to create any real tension on screen nwe don really care if douglas character lives or not because it isn believable nthe ending requires you to have believed anything that has happened previously but if you suspend disbelief and take the film as it is you can accept the game as an emotionally and psycholically disturbing thriller nmichael douglas gives terrific performance as nicholas ndouglas has played lonely businessmen before but here he adds another level to his performance nhis character who is normally level headed and relies on facts is forced to trust nobody ncan he believe the waitress he bumped into nwhat about his brother who got him involved in the game in the first place ndouglas portrays this aspect of his character extremely well and gives one of his best performances even better than his falling down persona nthe supporting cast is essential in this film and casting was critical nsean penn is always good and he gives yet another credible performance as douglas brother ndeborah kara unger from crash is the waitress he bumps into and her performance is extremely good nin fact she almost steals the film from douglas njames rebhorn portrays his character very well and adds some confusion and desparation to douglas predicament nanother good performance comes from armin mueller stahl from shine as the book editor nbut considering that douglas is in every single scene of the game he not only commands this cast but makes this distant and lonely character come to colorful life nthe game is rated for language violence some gore and some nudity and drugs nwhat is essential for this film to work is the writing njohn brancato and michael ferris have woven confusing and compelling screenplay with witty dialogue and some very funny moments nthis screenplay will probably get an oscar nomination for best original screenplay because it does almost exactly the same thing the usual suspects did nhowever the visuals of the game are enough to make the viewer enjoy the vexing plot nand if you can get yourself to believe everything occuring on the screen you will be thoroughly entertained by one of this year best films ',\n",

written as real people but merely as one dimensional caricatures nwhen an added layer to one of their personalities is revealed it is not to service the character development or to naturally offer up instinctive characterizations but to accommodate the convoluted plot nin lightweight comedy you might say it is not required to have perfectly realized figures just as long as they get the job done nunfortunately for comedy to work it has to at least succeed at being funny and if there was laugh meter available d guess that it briefly ascended around 2 5 of the time for me nsuffice to say the

the tulip and forces him to set up meeting since jill dream in life turns out being contract killer herself nhave you got all that nbecause there is more nmuch much more nand this is movie that without credits is little over 90 minutes and feels only like an hour the whole nine yards is an ultimately unsatisfying and empty headed excursion into well worn terrain already set by far superior pictures nhow the cast most of which are respectable actors got caught up in such cliched deficient film remains mystery unless they thought it might aspire to match the congenial screwball zaniness of director lynn 1985 comedy classic clue the movie ngoing into the theater preliminary comparisons between the two movies were unavoidable but by the twenty minute mark when had chuckled once and laughed nary single time it was clear this production was in serious trouble nsince the entire running time depends on the mechanisms of the plot and the screenplay inauspiciously written by mitchell kapner collapses with every failing comedy bit the film is an inevitable dead zone in the way of substance and frequently entertainment value the whole nine yards is neither facetious nor aside from the subplot about jill shocking eagerness to become professional hitwoman inventive and more often than not just lies there the film spinning drearily around and around in the projector but never igniting any sort of spark na few select actors do what they can with the material while others make no impact at all non the mediocre side are actually those playing the two central characters matthew perry and bruce willis nperry innocuously enjoyable on tv friends plays the same exact sitcom style character in all of his movies from 1997 fools rush in to 1999 three to tango and it has become crushing bore nmeanwhile willis makes next to no impression and because of the limited guise of his jimmy the tulip tudeski oftentimes disappears into the background ntheir three female counterparts fare noticeably better nbest of all is natasha henstridge far more radiant than in the exploitative species movies who adds unanticipated depth and emotion to cynthia nhenstridge has the talent for sure to break out of these countless throwaway roles but first she must fire her agent namanda peet has lot of fun as the quirkily straightforward and giddy jill and seems to know more about the art of comedic payoff than even perry who thus far has strived on career based solely on comedy nit is too bad then that peet is unnecessarily asked to disrobe in climactic scene with the obvious sole purpose being to show off her breasts nfinally rosanna arquette is awful as sophie but something tells me that was her purpose and her clear overacting only aids in brightening up her limited screen time nalso popping up is michael clarke duncan fresh off an oscar nomination for his role in the green mile as jimmy largely built friend and fellow killer frankie figs nwhen the whole nine yards eventually sputters to its underwhelming conclusion one is left pondering how such film ever got greenlit na great deal of movies of this type have been made in the past and this one is nothing but duplication of better films so what was the point nwithout passable screenplay or any notable technical accomplishments the whole nine yards rests solely on the presumed charm of the cast and half of the actors are not charming at all nnow what does that tell you ',\n",
              " 'the following review encompasses two versions of dune ndune the theatrical version 1984 runtime 137 minutes capsule review cut down to just over two hours by nervous studio executives the theatrical version of dune is spectacular mess and may be incomprehensible to those unfamiliar with the book nthe film visual splendour mystical beauty and impressive action scenes only partly compensate for gaping holes in the narrative ndune the extended version 1988 runtime 189 minutes capsule review bit of throw together assembled by mca tv special projects for cable television nit was disowned by director david lynch but it considerably closer to his original vision by virtue of its improved characterisation and clearer storyline nquality dubs of this version from the out of print japanese laserdisc release are available from various dealers on the world wide web the review nreleased in 1984 and made on then mammoth budget of 40 million the film of frank herbert cult novel dune was eagerly awaited by sci fi fans ndirector david lynch blue velvet eraserhead twin peaks was working on his biggest production to date mammoth undertaking filmed under trying conditions on location in mexico nthe screenplay was lynch own chosen after the script submitted by original author herbert was rejected ndune is set in universe ruled by powerful families overseen by successive line of emperors nthe key to cosmic power is the planet arrakis dune windswept desert planet that home to giant sandworms and the precious spice melange nthe spice is the most valuable commodity in the universe nit extends the life and expands the consciousness of those who consume it nmost importantly it allows the navigators of the spacing guild once human but now hideously mutated to fold space and navigate their spacecraft across mammoth distances instantaneously enabling interstellar commerce and trade to flourish nlynch film by necessity excises parts of the book while retaining the story two main strands none is the long standing rivalry between two families houses atreides and house harkonnen and their battle for lucrative mining rights on arrakis nthe second strand is the emergence of young paul atreides as the reluctant messiah long awaited by the natives of arrakis the fremen nthe deeply religious fremen want control over their homeworld and young paul may be the fulfilment of their prophecy that man would come from the outer worlds and lead them to freedom nunfortunately this epic story unfolds in confusing and haphazard manner in the theatrical cut of the film which runs 30 to 60 minutes shorter than what lynch originally intended nthe thinking among universal oh so wise money men was that films over two hours in duration were not popular with audiences at the time and would not do well at the box office nwith lynch initial cut running at closer to three or more hours the studio demanded that further cuts be made nwhat great idea nwhy not trim down an already complex film so as to make it almost incomprehensible nthe most glaring consequence of this one eyed stupidity is hopelessly jumpy narrative leaving us with badly underdeveloped characters nthus their personalities are vague their motivations unclear and in the case of paul father duke leto their demise rather meaningless nthe end result is distinct chill we can warm to most of the cast and we don care much for them nand it hardly helps that the voice over narration is sparse and that the dune esque language and terminology sounds like so much gobbledegook to those unfamiliar with the book ndune is also very serous film nthe constant self talk by various characters makes it so serious and self absorbed at times that you may find it hard not to wince with embarrassment nthe overall impression is world full of people so intense that no one is allowed joke lest the universe come crashing down around them nhumour or at least gentle kind of humour as distinct from the harkonnen mad sadistic kind is hard to find nyou may balk at the comparison but as writer lynch could well have done with some lessons from george lucus star wars trilogy nthe theatrical version is still some way from being complete disaster however nit still possesses enough of lynch stylistic quirks and enough visual invention to sustain the interest of viewers with taste for imaginative sci fi nspecial effects whiz carlo rambaldi giant sandworms are an awesome sight nboth the production design anthony masters and costume design bob ringwood are striking and original nand the magnificent score by toto and brian eno is one of the most underrated soundtracks of the last twenty years nwith these elements in place and the benefit of freddie francis lush cinematography the film is at least feast for the senses nsee it in the widescreen format if you can nand despite all the cuts several cast members still make strong impression most notably kenneth mcmillan as the supremely nasty baron vladimir harkonnen nsian phillips also registers strongly as the reverend mother gaius helen mohiam leader of the bene gesserit religious order who secret aim is to manipulate paul destiny for its own shadowy ends nas paul atreides the young kyle maclachlan starts off somewhat shakily but as his character grows in strength so does his performance and he emerges as credible leader of the fremen crusade nthe conclusion nany assessment of this film must take into account that frank herbert original novel is complex piece of work and presents tough challenge for any filmmaker ndavid lynch took brave stab at it and partly due to forces beyond his control ended up with an officially released version that fails in several key respects ndune certainly confused and frustrated lot of people on its release nmany chose to stay away altogether as the film disastrous box office showing attests nthe extended version however is rather different beast nin 1984 lynch stated his intention to release his own special edition director cut of the film on home video clear indication of his dissatisfaction with the version that ended up in the theatres nbut alas he failed to do so choosing to move on to other projects nin way then it is partly lynch own fault that what appeared instead was an unauthorised extended version put together in 1988 by mca tv special projects for airing on cable networks in the usa nstung into action lynch successfully petitioned the director guild to take his name off the credits and replace it with allen smithee the standard pseudonym for directors who wish to disown their own work nhe also had the screenwriting credit changed to the anonymous judas booth ncertainly looking at the results of mca handiwork there at least half dozen instances that for sheer technical sloppiness are good enough reasons for the director to object nbut these gripes must be considered in light of the improvements that the extended cut of dune offers in several crucial areas nmost of the changes involve the restoration or extension of cut scenes and the addition of extra narration both of which fill many holes in the original version storyline npaul relationship with his father and associates is more intimate with moments of humour and warmth lacking previously nthe political skulduggery involving the emperor the spacing guild the bene gesserits and the two warring houses is far better explained npaul initiation into the fremen way of life on arrakis is also fleshed out considerably nand as further background new prologue has been added featuring narration and painted stills to give us brief history of the dune universe nas piece of storytelling then mca tv version of dune is clearly superior nas piece of editing however it is at times surprisingly inept nthe use of painted stills in the new prologue works well enough but their occasional appearance once the action begins is inappropriate nthere some sloppy cutting too and in few instances shots even appear out of order nand the use of repeated footage to fabricate certain scenes eg nships coming and going soldiers coming and going is at times clearly out of context nthis is the kind of thing to which lynch objected and rightly so nit should also be noted that several questionable scenes and shots from the theatrical version were deleted to satisfy the censorship demands of s television nbut the most notable omission is gratuitous piece of nonsense from lynch that wasn even in herbert book nthe scene features baron harkonnen killing beautiful young man in front of his slobbering henchmen by pulling out his heart plug nits surreal and disturbing episode that very lynch esque but adds nothing to what we already know the baron is nasty piece of work ndespite its own peculiar flaws then the extended version of dune is generally superior film nall up it contains 35 minutes of restored footage and approximately another 15 minutes of either altered fabricated or newly created sequences nunless the idiosyncratic lynch has sudden change of heart the alan smithee version remains the closest we ll get to what the movie should have been non repeated viewings one suspects it is closer than what lynch would be prepared to admit nstill as one of this century great science fiction novels some fans and perhaps the late herbert himself would argue that dune deserved better fate in its

appropriately named the presence dj vivona rules over an alternate dimension where neither angels nor demons can touch him nfor kicks the presence likes to trick human into rounding up five of his or her friends so they can all be sent to his dimension and be systematically slaughtered nwhen something goes wrong and one of the presence recent victims escapes the angels and demons are alerted to his existence and feel he is threat that needs to be stopped nthey enlist the help of alison ramona midgett recent suicide victim to return to the flesh and follow the six new enlistees through the ice wall that surrounds the the nether realm nher mission is to melt away the ice barrier and allow the angels and demons access by reminding the presence of who he once was an ancient court jester named abraham who lost his job when his king and queen were killed nthe king sorcerer amblyn who also lost his job decided to take abraham under his wing as an apprentice nduring the downtime in his unemployment amblyn decided to create new dimension where sorcery evil and torture ruled nabraham wished to follow his master into this new realm so he was asked to show his devotion to the evil wizard by murdering his one true love nin this new realm amblyn would allow abraham to pursue the sport of hunting and destroying the humans that would be brought to this realm nafter each murder abraham would become stronger until his power surpassed that of amblyn nbecause of the screw up that allowed the recent escape abraham was able to destroy his master and take control of the realm himself nas alison quests to find abraham and show him the errors of his ways the six new hapless humans are allowed to live out their worst nightmares and then be brutally murdered nif there one thing can stand when see film it when the film is pretentious and arty just for the sake of being pretentious and arty nfilms like eraserhead and begotten are two of the worst examples of this and now ice from the sun can be added to this list nthis film is essentially an 80 minute stalk and slash film following the dante inferno idea that your hell corresponds to how you lived your life or any one of the plots to nightmare on elm street 3 through 6 intercut with almost 40 minutes of strange and supposedly haunting images many of which serve more to confuse than to further the plot nif there aren bizarre images floating past the screen then we get pointless shots of suicidal alison staring at her breakfast for minutes at time or contemplating whether or not she should answer her phone ncompelling but ultimately not nthe opening credits sequence is designed like music video for some unknown industrial band featuring various random images from the film interspersed with other random images nthe credits run the entire length of the song which is almost five minutes and the actual cast listing and other credit information doesn pop up until near the end of the sequence nwhen the opening credits began thought my vcr had accidentally cut off and interstitial from mtv2 had found its way to my tv nat least the music in the film is pretty decent made up of mostly industrial and hard rock music and even features song by ramona midgett nat the beginning of the film it is established that the presence possesses supernatural powers like shooting bullets out of the palms of his hands and decapitating people by waving his hand in front of them and he talks like darth vader clone without the heavy breathing nfor some reason though he delegates all of his main stalkings to what seems like the supporting cast of deliverance none over alled cretin handles the presence gravedigging and likes to chop peoples heads off with his shovel then there an inbred father dwight spurgin and his two inbred children mark kettler and jennifer poirrier wallace that take care of young woman who has been transformed into half dog half human mix with shotgun and of course big truck driving guy that likes to tie people up naked to the back of his vehicle and drag them across stone roads before pouring salt all over their wounds nwhy would you want to give responsibilities to bunch of rednecks when you yourself had all of these cool powers nand how is it that the fellow that screws over all of his buddies is able to round up exactly five friends to complete the number of people required to enter the realm at exactly the same time ni can barely get more than two together all at once at any given moment nthe most ridiculous segment though comes right before the aforementioned dragging salting sequence nthe character in question dana angela zimmely has her turn up to be killed and is standing at the front of movie theater in which the presence is seated na priest holding two naked dirty humans on leashes walks in and sits down next to large platter of fried chicken nhe picks up the entire platter and starts to enjoy the chicken taunting dana as she looks on with no interest whatsoever nwhen she starts to leave the priest chides her for going before the performance starts and then something that looks like either creature from gwar show or terry gilliam animation from monty python come to life walks out and makes like it wants to be crucified by her nthe presence starts to clap annoyingly which continues for the rest of the sequence until dana takes off with the strange creature following her nwhen it finally catches up to her she stabs it in its giant eyeball and is covered in slimy glop that spurts from the ruptured organ nthe box for the film claims because of the horrifying nature of the motion picture parental discretion is advised for persons under the age of 18 ncontains nudity and graphic violence nwhile both is certainly true there doesn seem to be much of either in any large amounts nbesides loving close up of spurting neck stump semi graphic self surgery scene and two instances of head trauma one run over and one melting most of the gore is just of the spraying blood or bloody wound covered body variety nas for nudity it is very sparse but at least we get to see angela zimmerly far and away the most attractive cast member before her body is bruised torn and bloodied by the dragging incident nice from the sun has been released on vhs by www movie com nit has been presented in in full frame only and the transfer for film shot

brain into computer has all been gleaned from such sources as the terminator dark city and few star trek episodes both classic and next generation nwhat is new is the ability to weave all of these various elements together and succeed in producing film that is both entertaining as well as thought provoking nkeanu reeves plays computer whiz nicknamed neo who is plucked out of the artificial world known as the matrix by group of renegade humans who are clandestinely fighting to expose the fallacy of the computer generated existence and free humankind from the oppression of the machines nthe group leader morpheus laurence fishburne has chosen neo because he believes neo is the one who is destined to lead the attack against the artificial intelligence from the beginning of the film we are kept on our toes trying to figure things out nthis in lesser movie would be annoying but the matrix presents itself in an intelligent manner which makes the puzzle rather interesting and even fun nwhat is reality nwhat is sham nthe film turns our very perception of life on its side nmore than once we are also presented with the question of whether we would rather know the harsh truth of reality or live life of relative bliss oblivious to the true nature of our surroundings nas viewers this is intriguing enough so imagine what it would be like for neo nand who to better play bewildered person than keanu reeves nreeves whom ve never really cared for as an actor is competent in roles which require lot of straightforwardness and little subtlety nhe was good in speed for example but laughably poor in walk in the clouds nneo is actually one of those roles which reeves slips into rather nicely so much of my expectation was happily for naught nin couple of places the script even capitalizes upon his wooden nature and this is heavy credit to writers directors andy and larry wachowski ni mean since bill and ted excellent adventure what movie could you say really utilized keanu reeves nmore interesting than reeves is fishburne who morpheus nearly runs the gamut of emotions and convincingly so nvery surprising for sci fi movie nfishburne also maintains certain demeanor about himself throughout as if he always knows what to expect nthis helps to further the aura of his character proficiency and extensive knowledge nhugo weaving as agent smith one of the artificial intelligence anti intruder programs is also good playing his deadpan no nonsense kick ass role which requires him to show emotion at the appropriate time nunfortunately when weaving speaks for more than few sentences in row the nature of his character speech pattern becomes little more laughable than impressive ncarrie anne moss plays trinity morpheus number one assistant who becomes somewhat of love interest for neo nalthough her character is somewhat inconsistent moss nevertheless delivers an above par performance when fishburne isn in the picture nthere were few expenses spared when it comes to the special effects nmany methods of imagery are employed from modeling to bluescreen to computer graphics nof special note is the use of the freeze and turn effect where the entire scene is frozen turned then continued from new angle nthis is accomplished by using large number of still cameras employed in semi circle with motion picture cameras placed at the two ends nthe motion cameras film the action and at the appropriate moment all the still cameras fire at once nplace each still image in film sequence and you get nearly seamless transition from the first motion camera to the second npretty slick nthe matrix drips with style nfrom the clothing to the music to the action we re watching an exaggerated version of what we re used to nmuch of it seems like the combination of two genres of the hong kong action film there a lot of kung fu there a lot of gunplay nwhen character is letting go with an automatic weapon much is made of the empty cartridges falling to the floor in slow motion nthere also the element of the japanese action cartoon called anime by aficionados especially in the way the sequences are filmed in sweeping pans and emphasized actions through

              " 'jaws is rare film that grabs your attention before it shows you single image on screen nthe movie opens with blackness and only distant alien like underwater sounds nthen it comes the first ominous bars of composer john williams now infamous score ndah dum nfrom there director steven spielberg wastes no time taking us into the water on midnight swim with beautiful girl that turns deadly nright away he lets us know how vulnerable we all are floating in the ocean and once jaws has attacked it never relinquishes its grip nperhaps what is most outstanding about jaws is how spielberg builds the movie nhe works it like theatrical production with first act and second act nunlike so many modern filmmakers he has great deal of restraint and refuses to show us the shark until the middle of the second act nuntil then he merely suggests its presence with creepy subjective underwater shots and williams music nhe building the tension bit by bit so when it comes time for the climax the shark arrival is truly terrifying nhe doesn let us get bored with the imagery nthe first act opens with police chief martin brody roy scheider new york cop who has taken an easy peaceful job running the police station on amity island fictitious new england resort town where there hasn been murder or gun fired in 25 years nthe island is shaken up by several vicious great white shark attacks right before the fourth of july and the mayor larry vaughn murray hamilton doesn want to shut down the beaches because the island is reliant on summer tourist money nbrody is joined by matt hooper richard dreyfuss young ambitious shark expert from the marine institute nhooper is as fascinated by the shark as he is determined to help brody stop it his knowledge about the exact workings of the shark it a perfect engine an eating machine make it that much more terrifying nwhen vaughn finally relents hooper and brody join crusty old shark killer named quint robert shaw on his decrepit boat the orca to search for the shark nthe entire second act takes place on the orca as the three men hunt the shark and inevitably are hunted by it jaws is thriller with keen sense of humor and an incredible sense of pacing tension and horror nit is like ten movies all rolled into one and it no wonder it took america by storm in the summer of 1975 taking in enough money to crown it the box office champ of all time until it was unceremoniously dethroned in 1977 by star wars neven today fascination with this film is on par with hitchcock psycho and it never seems to age nalthough grand new technology exists that makes the technical sequences including several mechanical sharks obsolete none of it could improve the film because it only would lead to overkill nthe technical limitations faced by spielberg in 1975 may have actually produced better film because it forced him to rely on traditional cinematic elements like pacing characterization sharp editing and creative photography instead of simply dousing the audience with digital shark effects nscheider dreyfuss and shaw were known actors at the time jaws was made but none of them had the draw of robert redford or paul newman nnevertheless this film guaranteed them all successful careers because each gave an outstanding performance and refused to be overshadowed by the shark nscheider hits just the right notes as sympathetic husband and father caught in the political quagmire of doing what right and going against the entire town it your first summer here you know mayor vaughn warns him ndreyfuss who had previously been seen in american graffiti 1973 and the apprenticeship of duddy kravitz 1974 gives surprisingly mature complex performance for someone who had literally only played kids and teenagers nhowever most outstanding is the gnarled performance by robert shaw as the movie captain ahab performance sorely overlooked by the academy awards nbordering of parody shaw plays quint as grizzled old loner whose machismo borders on masochism nhe slightly deranged and shaw performance is almost caricature nhowever there is one scene late in the film when he and brody and hooper are below deck on the orca comparing scars nquint is drawn into telling the story of his experiences aboard the s nindianapolis navy ship in world war ii that was sunk by the japanese nhis tale of floating in the water for more than week with over 1 000 other men while swarms of sharks slowly devoured them them is actually more hair raising than anything spielberg put on screen nshaw delivers the story in one long take and it is the best acting in the film nof course we can leave out the shark itself with its black eyes endless rows of teeth and insatiable urge to eat it is basically the epitome of all mankind fears about what is unknown and threatening in nature na shark is such perfect nemesis it is real having survived sinch the dinosaurs great whites do exist they can be as large as the shark in jaws and they are threat nevery one of spielberg subjective underwater shots makes us feel queasy because lets us see how we look to the shark bunch of writihing dangling completely unprotected legs just ready to be chomped into nthe shark in jaws was actually combination of actual footage and five different mechanical sharks all nicknamed bruce by the crew built to be shot from different angles nmany have forgotten but jaws was sort of precursor to waterworld 1995 movie who soggy production and cost overruns had universal studios worried about bomb nbut as we can see now spielberg overcame all the obstacles and delivered one of the finest primal scare thrillers ever to come out of hollywood ',\n",

obvious given particuarly looking from the standpoint of mr cameron early works nin fact virus is yet another in the long line of action horror paranoia thrillers from the aliens vein group of people are dropped into mysterious situation only to find mortally threatening entity is out to get them textbook example hailing all the way back to the early talkies and maybe even to the first pictures albeit redeveloped by cameron in his 1986 blockbuster that earned him esteem and bigger budgets to come in his future nno such thing will happen to bruno whom believe worked in some capacity on that quasi landmark feature while bruno may have studied under cameron wing for years and years m beginning to wonder at what capacity and what exactly did he learn from him nin fact virus should at least be mediocre the fact that bruno could have worked under man like cameron director who if anything just knows how to make movie and then make film like virus is just another detraction fairly aimed at this grade schlockfest of film albeit z grade schlockfest with respectable budget nthe film seems to not only borrow it plot from last year similarly fated deep rising but also from clunkish movie from the 80s called leviathan an underwater thriller starring peter weller richard crenna hector elizando and daniel stern about group of miners who stumble upon an alien lifeform that was part alien part john carpenter twisted remake of the thing virus again has similar uh selling point group of sailors on boat stumble upon russian cruiser that is dead in the water nthey get on nthey break up into pairs and investigate nand they find an alien lifeform on board that comes in the form of energy has taken over all the machines on board have meshed the machines with parts from corpses and have deemed humankind their enemy because of misquote in the dictionary ha ha nnot that any of this is for second scary or the least bit involving not only does this film start off with chintzy bond ian opening the destruction of the cruiser via satellite transmission from mir destroying any of the suspense in what could happen but it also fails to bring us any interesting chracters nof its motley crew it only choses as its potentially eccentric cast of characters lead woman skipper masculine potential romantic interest drunken captain black technician tatooed aborigine manic russian survivor and couple other candidates for alien food none whom are the least bit interesting or more dimensional than thin plain piece of writing paper nand it not the traditional argument for films like these where you may in fact want them all to be eaten even aliens played with the karma of the arrogant soldiers but this was more of plus side for the film as whole than the opposite instead as another cliche goes you just don give damn ni almost don even have to say that the acting from everyone ranges from sub par to horrific the former being jamie lee curtis in the lead showing off what strong female lead she is and she is just not really here and the latter being and it pains me to say this as he a particular favorite of mine donald sutherland who plays the captain so poorly and without second of credibility that this will go down as the performance of which he should be ashamed nlike anthony hopkins for legends of the fall the line scrooooooo em has been thus embroidered upon my membrance nor peter toole in caligula ngreat actor horrific performance nit happens every now and then and it only helps sutherland career that no one except for an elite few even bothered to see this film nthough it has sat on the shelves of universal studios for about two years waiting until it can be released and make as much money as it possibly can read early january when everyone still trying to catch up on the potential oscar nominees it does show that universal shelled out pretty penny to make this film it laden with complex machinery boasts respectable production design and it may even feature believable special effects if of course or anyone else could see them virus mostly takes place on large abandoned cruiser and mostly at night until the dawn and mostly without the use of lights not so much for the productivity of the alien creatures in their pursuit of their human prey but more so because as the hollywood cliche seems to go if it dark enough then the special effects will be more believable nand if you don believe me go back and rent godzilla and tell me if there even one shot where we see godzilla either in his entirety in one wide shot or n the light so that we can at least see him well you don really have to sit through it again just take my word for it nbut all of this doesn matter since virus is basically just one loud cluttered mess of movie nthe action scenes are muddled and as difficult to follow as any action movie ve ever seen my um favorite part was the scene where trio of them end up somehow on the outside of the ship during five minute bouillabaisse of tidal waves rain and any other ocean extremeties the film can cook up then end up back in the ship when one of them is revealed to have apparently drowned well must say thanks for telling me afterwards because sure couldn figure it out when saw it nimagine the first attack of the aliens in aliens shot from the pov of the soldiers and then the authorities in the battle car if it was all hard to follow and done without any dramatic intensity and that basically the whole of virus one horribly directed action scene after the other capping it off with proposterous gadget that saves the day and at least couple of the original cast members nand my god it a long damn sit nwith no interesting characters no dramatic urgency no tension not one good moment of action and no mesmerizing visuals it a wonder that it even got made nwe already know that big movie studios mentality is shallow at best and movies like out of sight and saving private ryan give you more faith in them but movies like virus manage to drain little more out of the pool ni almost wish that instead of making this movie john bruno had gone cinema verite and captured the meetings with universal heads when they gave this film green light nthey read the script they knew they were entrusting millions upon millions of dollars into director who might have very well been cameron hack and he is and they still went ahead with the project only to have bruno and company shit back in their face neven though hold universal in contempt for making this horrible movie d say even more contempt should be aimed at mr bruno for making movie that could be this bad nin fact shouts of egad man what were you doing when you worked for cameron anyway nare not only justifiable but encouraged ',\n",
              " 'it been good long while since we had good old fashioned thriller where mostly everything goes right for the audience and wrong for the characters but it been even longer since saw thriller that actually shock cared for the characters not merely judged them but actually allowed their human foibles flaws and strengths to emerge so radiantly ni saw that it been at least couple decades even as far back to the great hitchcock thrillers though m hardly comparing simple plan to say rear window or strangers on train nyet it almost as good nit simple yet strangely complex and astonishingly rewarding because instead of moving from plot point to plot point and merely laying out they might be caught overtones it instead concerns itself with the moral corruption and depths of greed that its protagonists can go to all without ever judging them as either evil or even immoral nelegantly directed by sam raimi yes the same simple plan concerns itself with the discovery of crashed plane and within bag full of millions of dollars by an upright moderately financially stable working man bill paxton his dim witted brother billy bob thornton and his drinking buddy brent briscoe nwithout anyone around and the possibility that no one would come looking for it the three debate and debate but finally reach the decision that yes they will keep it but until any authorities or possible owners of the cash come looking and so they generally don flaunt anything they don want to flaunt they ll keep it stored away in the custody of paxton nthe possibilites of this circumstance are much diverse they could endlessly play cat and mouse with the authorities they could try to fight off the rightful owners who are either villainous or just or they could fight amongst themselves a simple plan though borrows little from each of these na little tiff with the cops here subplot involving an alleged fbi agent chilling gary cole there and bit of inside feuding over here nbut as austin powers would say that not necessarily its bag baby nwhat most admired about this film and what makes this far superior and unique thriller is that it successfully able to have its cake and eat it too nit effectively involves some of the traditional thriller cliches like the ones mentioned above but at the same time it involves itself more deeply with the way the characters become morally corrupt and what price they have to pay to have what they think is happiness in black duffle bag nso while steps are taken to neatly cover things up and these subsequent steps go miserably awry the film choses to never loose the sight that in covering things up to the extent that these characters have to they are slowly losing their souls and their humanity nin one early scene paxton and thornton have to make trip back to the plane to return some of the money so it doesn look like it was all stolen not bad idea when thornton screws up as he does continuously throughout the movie and paxton has to do some major covering up read homicide ninstead of quick murder and immeadiate hands washing raimi shows lengthy painful shot from low angle onto paxton face as he tries to sift through his emotions and reach conclusion nthere a similar shot afterwards of paxton watching the murder he committing and taking in all the horror which is also wonderfully effective but the previous shot is even better more morally complex and more gut wrenching nin short probably the best piece of direction raimi ever done demonstrating once again that sometimes the simplest way to do something yields the best results for further proof watch persona sex scene and witness what may be the best scene ingmar bergman ever done nbut the film hardly stops here it follows completely through and rarely loses sight of its characters humanity and the depletion thereof nyet it also moves from step to step in such graceful method that we never feel like the film is merely stamping out the plot points of the story nwhen the time comes for paxton to start becoming selfish and thus diabolical with aid from his pregnant wife played by bridget fonda pal to raimi he does and soon the horror of the situation is escalating to tragic heights nthere at least two grand shootouts and at least one of them may be one of the greatest shootouts in cinema history and when they arrive they don come with masochistic delight but with cringe inducing horror nduring the one was actually sinking into my chair with the mantra they can do this can they nstreeming through my head nin fact this film which is getting many comparisons to the coen superior but forget about it fargo has many similar moments of manic insanity attributed to the major amount of subtlety and restraint with which the directors direct what in other hands would be over the top distractedness imagine suppose robert rodriguez directing this then nagain after seeing the evil dead films d hardly assume raimi would be able to pull something like this off although there are moments of the film which are easily dubbed raimi moments rifle shot notwithstanding ninstead raimi directs with maturity and gentle touch easily letting the story and characters co exist while still letting some of the more traditional raimi elements come out like some offbeat comic touches nmost particularly billy bob thornton character jacob is brilliant creation nhis dim wittedness is often hilarious for most of the film every line he uttered was greeted with howling laughter but there authenticity to the performance that strangely enough makes sure that we re not totally laughing at him nthe chuckles he gets are not necessarily ones of full condescension because thornton is so damn real njacob a multi dimensional character and while being stupid we see that as not so much flaw but strength to his character his simplicity is endearing and many of the acts he commits are out of strong inner strength and belief system primarily towards the middle where his bud and co conspirator begins to make some heavy waves concerning the money nthe final third of the film spends much time with him and many of the touches upon his character not only by thornton but also by screenwriter scott smith adapting his own book by the way are just great ni particularly admired back story about an old high school girlfriend told by thornton with such sincerity and acception that the cruel story is reversed to near sweetness and further strength of his saddened character nthornton is absolutely brilliant in this performance by far the best performance he ever given and further proof that he the best character actor in contemporary cinema if you don believe me go back and watch his wonderful performance in primary colors performance that would have been nominated for an oscar if this hadn been in the same year because he easily able to slip into character and make him completely and utterly believable nhe brings so much weight to the film that as it is with most character actors it difficult picturing anyone else in the role nthe rest of the cast is great too from paxton declining working man to chelcie ross amiable town sheriff neven fonda shows off her talents nicely nand if had any complaints about the film it that the plot is almost too simplistic and that at times it seems too much like an exercise like cruel test on humanity that still pays attention to the humanity involved nand the occasional narration is as it usually is annoying narration should be used with extreme caution especially when you re trying to set things up and or express emotions didn raimi watch the first murder scene nand the thing that can most usually go wrong with movie the ending is basically amiss ni won reveal it but it way too cruel and too much of an outsider set up as if the appearance of plane wasn already too much of that anyway nfor film that deals so much and so intimately with the humanity of the characters involved this is the wrong ending nimagine character controlled ending otherwise it like if in crime and punishment if the police had caught him instead of him breaking down and confessing not that m at all comparing simple plan to dostoevsky nthe ending does work despite my protestations but to me there was something incessantly nagging and unsatisfying about it but if you had no qualms and were happy as clam with it then just ignore me and go about your day nbut despite my mere claims make no mistake that was completely and utterly edge of my seat throughout and even sometimes curdling up by the situations that occured not because of any kind of gore factor which is thankfully for this very minimal but because the film places its characters in situations and gives them such painful things to overcome that ve frankly not seen much like it in quite awhile nat least not since the previous worthy hitchcockian masterpiece ',\n",
              " 'most people fit into two different categories you either love woody allen or you hate his guts nmy family for the most part hates him and his movies ni think he very funny but his shtick has gotten forced and contrived over the years nso maybe taking his body away was the best decision any producer could have thought of nunrestrained by physical boundaries allen humor comes shining through nthose who had problems with his physical appearance will be able to join the rest of us in laughing at allen intelligent observations of life nthose who had problems with his verbal comedy may want to skip this one nin 1995 film was introduced to audiences which sparked their imaginations and showed them something they never seen before ntoy story used state of the art computer technology and presented world of toys who would come alive when no humans were present nmany critics will call that better film but believe they only say that because it was completely original motion picture nantz however has upped the ante considerably ndisney a bug life isn due out for another two months and dreamworks seems to have received the better end of the deal nby beating disney out they have satisfied the audience thirst for computer animated films nbut don let that fool you disney is definitely not scared nin the past two years competitions have broken out between studios nin 1997 it was the volcano duel nin my opinion dante peak came out way ahead of its predecessor both in time and in quality nvolcano had an original premise but destroyed that with some very ridiculous situations nin 1998 there are twice as many competing films nfirst was the comet competition and armageddon blew away it cheesily dramatic competitor deep impact nbut now it even more interesting as one beloved studio disney goes up against the newcomer dreamworks nwho will prevail ntime will tell but m sure that mr mouse has nothing to fear nthis may sound like didn like antz on the contrary d put it up there with toy story nbut due to it pg rating many parents may be put off by some of the dialogue which shouldn appear in disney version nsome of the dialogue in antz pushes the envelope for family oriented film nsexual innuendoes and profanity pop up occasionally which makes dreamworks animated feature geared more for an adult crowd nthe humor is also written especially for adults though many kids were laughing in the theater attended nthis is the type of film that should be made for families more often entertaining for kids and entertaining for parents nantz begins with hilarious monologue which seems meld between woody allen shtick and franz kafka metamorphosis the short story of man who wakes up to discover himself as bug nz allen is troubled ant believing he was not made to be worker when you re the middle child in family of five million he comments about his neglected childhood none night is sitting in bar with his friend weaver sylvester stallone discussing his pathetic place in life nin walks princess bala sharon stone whom no one recognizes without crown nbala asks is he would like to dance and they engage in pulp fiction esque dance while everyone else is following the leader nafter discovering that she is the princess falls in love but there a problem bala is getting married to general mandible gene hackman ruthless leader who merely wants to control better and stronger colony nin order to do that he must eliminate not only the queen anne bancroft but the weakest of the colony namely the worker ants nbut to get rid of the queen he needs to get rid of the loyal army ants who would be willing to die for her nhe and colonel cutter christopher walkin come up with plan to send the loyal ants off to battle where they will surely be killed nthe queen is reluctant at first but decides it is best for the colony nmeanwhile wants to meet bala again and he asks weaver an army ant to switch places with him nso gets sent off to battle but he manages to survive the slaughter by the termites nthe battle sequence is absolutely stunning though you may have flashbacks to starship troopers which contained very similar sequence nhowever antz and that 1997 film were both in production around the same time so the similarities are merely coincidence nthe second half of the film revolves around s kidnapping of bala and their search for mythical place called insectopia nthere an ant can be his own boss and have all the food he wants nthe adventures and bala get into are surprisingly high in tension especially one involving magnifying glass nlooming over the targets like the spaceships from independence day in fact m just going to assume that the producers referenced id4 intentionally nthe ants look up in awe and then beam of fire blasts into the ground nvisually it an exciting rush of adrenaline nbut don be fooled nlittle kids shouldn see this as they may just try and copy it nafter seeing antz vowed never to intentionally step on an ant again nhopefully children will learn that killing ants is rather cruel nas an animated film antz is probably the best you will find to date nvisually it as stunning as what dreams may come nthe best aspect of animation is the fact that the characters aren limited by gravity nthey can take ridiculous situations and make them seem plausible none great moment involves mass of worker ants bunching up to form wrecking ball nthe animation is so perfect that you can virtually see every single ant on the ball nhowever the most exhilarating scene involves bala getting stuck to the bottom of young boy shoe nit truly great example of film making at its finest nwith computer technology the animators have carefully made the ants faces look similar to the actors providing the voices nthe best example would have to be barbatus danny glover nat one point you can even see the pores on his face although doubt ants have pores ndo they nbarbatus also has touching but rather gruesome scene as he has his final words with without body nyoung kids may be disturbed by the site of dismembered head but good deal of humor is derived more appropriate for adults of course ndisney a bug life looks good but don know if they will be able to best dreamworks newest animated feature in terms of animation nif not then dreamworks will have done something no other studio could do go head to head with the big mouse and knock him down yes anastasia was good but not nearly as good as even the worst of disney nvocal talent is always essential to an animated feature and antz has one of the best line ups seen since toy story nin fact it far exceeds that one nwoody allen has always been funny but here he transcends most of what he done in the past few years nwithout body his comic timing is the most noticeable thing nin fact m pretty sure that the writers let him improvise lot of his lines nsharon stone as bala shows off some of her comic ability though for the most part stone works best as dramatic actress nsylvester stallone teamed up with stone once again is beginning to solidify his statement that he wants to be an actor not typecast action star nafter snub at the oscars last year stallone is proving himself as the serious or comedic as illustrated here actor that he is ngene hackman is superb as the gruff talking general almost doing another take on his crimson tide persona nchristopher walkin is probably more noticed by his voice and so many people will remember him from such hits as batman returns nanne bancroft has minimal role but she effective nonetheless ndanny glover has small role but he does very very good job ndan aykroyd and jane curtin also lend their voices as two lovesick euro trash bees both are very unrecognizable especially aykroyd njennifer lopez plays worker ant who falls in love with weaver although most people won recognize her voice either nmany people will recognize grant shaud voice as the foreman nhe played miles on the tv show murphy brown nthis is definitely huge cast with some high profile names and it will definitely help it grosses nof course you can probably tell where lot of the 60 million budget went to also ndirectors eric darnell and lawrence guterman are relative newcomers though guterman did direct 1994 feature headless nbut both show an incredible talent for this type of picture ntense at times and very funny throughout the two hold this film together like professionals nthe screenplay by todd alcott and chris weitz is quite simple in plot but it contains lot of subtlety that makes the film more suitable for adults nkids will delight in the animation while parents can laugh heartily at the humor nmost of it will go over young children heads ndoes that mean you shouldn take kids to see it nnot at all nthey will have lot of fun watching this one nwhat is great is the themes that are given to us npart social commentary part romance story and part moral drama antz gives everyone something to talk about whether it be the animation or the discussions of individualism and community nthankfully it not subtle in either aspects nantz is rated pg for mild language and some intense action nsometimes the language can be pushing the limits for family movie but the violence is what should keep kids at home nthe battle scene has ants melting in acid and bugs being speared to death nand the magnifying scene shows an ant disintegrate in the beam of sunlight nbut other than that and some sexual innuendos it a perfect choice for some wholesome fun at the theaters ni doubt many children will understand the sexual innuendos unless they are old enough but it still advisable to leave really young children at home nhave confused you enough nif you do take your kids recommend seeing the film with them because more than likely you ll enjoy it the most ',\n",

              " 'i 2 the sequel to mission impossible is james bond wannabe film but it fails to even come close to that film in wit humor and entertainment value nit tries to be spy romance movie but without any suspense the film just looks like it an extended commercial for dudes who think they look cool in throwaway sunglasses nit is film that prefers techie gadgets to anything human nthe coolest thing about this movie was all the holes it had in its story and the most trite thing about the movie was the usage of doves throughout as peace symbols nthe film plays as if it was wet fantasy dream about techie violence nexcept for the choreographed action sequences the film was dull for three quarters of its time filled with too many dead spots in its story to garner concern about its wooden characters or the superficial romance that developed nas for the action scenes they might look good to those who are converts to violence in their films but their advertisement for sadistic responses is nothing short of mindless cartoon violence which makes it very difficult to sit back and applaud without feeling put off by the gratuitous cruelty seen nm 2 opens and closes with fast paced action scenes but it is hard to get past the middle part which just drags on in banal dialogue nthe film looks as if it had been invaded by computer virus at that point nthe only thing that kept me awake was the horrible music composed by hans zimmer that became very loud at any of the film supposedly momentous action scenes and seemed to make an uninteresting scene even more noticeable in

two guns blazing and of fire explosions but he just can seem to handle dialogue and suspense nthe star of the film and co producer tom cruise and his romantic interest thandie newton are miscast ncruise is no james bond and looks more like yuppie than superhero in his stylish long hair and innocuous smile as he tries to carry off this macho role while thandie is not an action film girl and seems like fish out of water in this one ntheir romance didn work not only was it tepid and not sexy but it wasn convincing nthe film opens with dizzying speed perhaps with the hope that befuddled audience is its best bet for success nwe will be in three different locations instantaneously sydney the american southwest and seville nfirst we are in sydney australia where scientist with muffled russian accent dr nekhorvich rade mentions that he created deadly killer virus called chimera and an antidote for it nhe also mentions that every hero needs worthy villain nwhich explains the film

is taken over by terrorists who set it on automatic pilot and crash it into the rocky mountains nbefore they crash the plane and parachute out of it the one who was posing as dimitri turns out to be sean ambrose scott rogue member of the imf which is cia like clone nhe steals the package with the antidote peels off latex mask which is replica of the hero of the story ethan hunt cruise who had posed as dimitri to the scientist before and had thereby gained his trust nsean and his group of terrorists carry out this attack because they plan virus plague on the world and then to sell the victims the antidote at marked up prices nwe already saw the gimmick of peeling masks used in face off and in the original mission impossible which as convoluted plot as that film had it was still

played by will smith who embodies him with about as much will smith charm as he can without entering id4 men in black territory nhe a good dramatic actor just see the first half hour of six degrees of separation for proof of this not that he isn great the whole time and here he makes his character likable and sympathetic without any real strain on his character which makes the film lack any real deep interesting qualities nsmith becomes involved in mass conspiracy involving the assasination of senator opposed to government law that would create world surveillance extinguishing privacy as we know it from the world under the pretense that it would make crime easier to control when he is passed disk of the event caught on tape by an outside party nature observer played by uh jason lee nthe government wants the disk and is prepared to destroy his life to get it nas smith plight is dramatized we are introduced to the masterminds who surveillance him sitting in vans disguised as other businesses staring at computers and pulling out tricks faster than speeding bullet nthese guys played by jack black jamie kennedy and seth green are the most interesting part of this film because they re well fascinating they re doing their jobs which are evil but the film doesn view them as such and they almost become our friends nwe like these guys for the sole reason that the film doesn automatically judge them as the villains nthey re also scary because we get the idea that they re not fully aware of the impact their jobs have on the world nit as if they re obsessed with their jobs not because they re evil but because hey it a fun job and no one else can do it like them nunfortunately this also backfires bit on the film instead of being the flashlight in the darkened room that the game was you see everything and are thus not as freaked out because you know what is going on nsure you re chilled but you re not exacty freaked out by what going on nbut what do you expect from tony scott the man who never met five second piece of film he ever liked nhe a not bad director because hell he is always interesting to watch if not occasionally moronic exhibit days of thunder but the reason he not great is because he too technical and calculated nhis shots are perfectly executed and leave nothing to the imagination and they re always making sure you re paying attention nthis is incredibly annoying and it reduces enemy of the state to mechanical mishmash of flashy images that never expand the mind at any great depths but still manage to entertain without any real problems ndespite never actually becoming great it never actually boring and it always intriguing nwatching the government set up smith is endlessly fascinating and since we care about smith likeable protagonist we are set up for good two hours worth of tom clancy esque entertainment nadd the best big cast this side of the annual woody allen film everyone from gabriel byrne to dan butler pop up for cameos and you ve got good old fashioned escapist drama which does all the thinking for you so that you never have to actually question the debate over personal privacy and so you can follow will

more ominous because the threat is real nit human and while the script takes some artistic licence the way in which the diabolical killer works here is actually realistic nthat is if human being could

says that what he is doing will be remembered by everyone nno serial killer has ever been so creative se7en is blatantly unsubtle with its messages about the horrors of the world and it often little too depressing nwhat it lacks in those areas it makes up for with believable dialogue top notch screenwriting unexpected twists and realistic characters nthe technical aspects of the film are unobtrusive nfincher uses lighting music and editing quite well but his story is always the thrust of the film nfortunately we don find out what happens to mills and somerset after the closing credits

which have been bad is richard linklater slacker dazed and confused before sunrise and suburbia all nwhich were great nnow adore quentin tarantino nhis first two films were classic films the second one being one of the greatest films of all time nbut 1995 just wasn that good of year for him nhe made way too many tv appearances nhe mispronounced jackie chan name on the mtv movie awards nand he made this film he was also awarded an oscar so guess that would be grand exception nrobert rodriguez is also great director not brilliant one but cool one ni ve never seen an alexandre rockwell or allison anders film so can comment on them nbut in this crap ensemble director film all four give pitiful efforts npitiful for any director too nnow in all fairness ensemble director pieces never really work out ni ve never seen all of new york stories but have heard the first two films by scorsese and francis ford coppola are crap saw woody one which was hilarious but not totally up to par

this one though he has couple good moments is working on new year eve for his first shift in an old fancy hotel nhe the only one there again and he only has couple rooms yet again nthe old bellhop the seemingly immortal marc lawrence who hated pulp fiction actually hands over his cap to ted and he goes to his job happily nas the night goes on he becomes increasingly annoyed and hostile nyea the short films are presented in order btw nthe missing ingredient writer director allison anders starring sammi davis amanda decadenet valeria golino madonna ione skye lili taylor alicia witt nthis one starts it off horribly with no plot no intrigue and crap dialogue nthe situation is so terrible that it physically painful to watch nthe plot has something to do with coven of witches needing sperm to bring back godess who is gasp nstuck inside some object in their hotel room nthe witch that was supposed to bring it ione skye calls up ted and asks him if she can perform fellatio on him to get it nyeah that what said nstupid plot inane characters who aren interesting at all etc etc etc the only good thing about this is it has good cast which in turn it wastes pitifully nnot even actually funny for second nmy rating out of 5 no stars nthe wrong man writer director alexandre rockwell starring david proval jennifer beals and laurence bender nanother bad little film with another stupid sex thing going on nted stumbles into the wrong room or something and gets in the middle of couple david proval and jennifer beals in her attempt at coming back who are playing sex games nted tries to escape and we cheer him on so it will end soon nbut at least this has bit of comedy in it just not that much nand david proval has never overacted as much nand it pulp fiction producer laurence bender who gets to puke from window na masterpiece compared to the first one but still nthe misbehavers writer director robert rodriguez starring antonio banderes tamlyn tomita lana mckissack danny verduzco salma hayek nwould robert rodriguez film be the same without salma hayek navel nnope nluckily she on the tv dancing so we get to see her nsurprisingly enough when read the screenplay about year before actually seeing it this one seemed to have the most potential nit was fast paced funny and well funny nbut when watched it it seemed anti climactic and only seemed to gain any momentum towards the end when everything happened at once nantonio overacts nicely and the two kids lana and danny are funny nbut as said it moves slowly and in that way it more painful than funny nbut the ending was stupid and funny at the same time noh nthe plot antonio is supposed gangster assumed really who leaves his two troubling kids home while he and his wife tomita go out to get drunk at new year party nantonio hires ted for couple bucks to watch his kids all night long but things go wrong it nwas okay nthe man from hollywood writer director quentin tarantino starring quentin tarantino bruce willis paul calderon and jennifer beals again nironically this one could be considered the best for bad reason it best represents what quentin has done with this film nhe plays chester spoiled brat actor or something who has just had huge box office hit on his hands and is living it up by playing an anti climactic game from hitchcock tv episode starring steve mcqueen and peter lorre where they gamble to see if one of them can get light from his lighter ten times in row nthey re drunk and need sober but nervous ted to hold the cleaver and bring it down if the lighter doesn light nthey also pay him lot of cash nthis is so much exactly what this little film is about that it campy ntim roth was probably payed lot of money to do this stupid part in this stupid film made by bunch of people who are high on themselves cause they ve had hits major or minor nit took quentin to realize that nbut the thing is it doesn seem like he realizes that nif he did d give this good 3 stars nbut this sucked nit was anti climactic and the dialogue wasn very good nhe starts off with very long steadicam shot then goes to flashes nthat makes no sense nit cool for while then he makes it uneven nit long and it just not very good nhopefully quentin never repeats what he did with this one nconclusion what the moral here nif you ve made celebrated films don do an ensemble piece nthey should have re watched new york stories and then stopped in their tracks nnone of these have any point to them and they re embarrassing to not only the writer directors but to the actors cause they re working with crap nbut will forgive everyone involved and especially look forward to quentin next directing job even though he and rodriguez jumped back to the top immeadiately with the cool from dusk till dawn which found

gloomy decade marked by lost ideals of 1968 rampant inflation and unemployment international terrorism fuel crisis and loss of faith in almost anything that previous generation stood for nfeelings of despair and nihilism found its reflections in many films of that era nmartin scorsese taxi driver which symbolises both the glory and despair of the seventies is most celebrated of them all nthe movie protagonist is travis bickle robert de niro 26 year old former marine who takes the job of taxi driver in new york city because he can sleep at nights nthe job gets him exposed to the dark side of apocalyptic megalopolis and travis gradually gets alienated from the rest of world nthe only bright spot in his life is betsy cybil sheperd attractive woman working in senator palantine presidential campaign ntheir date ends as humiliating fiasco because travis makes fatal mistake by inviting her to porno movie theatre nlosing his only link to better side of the world travis gradually descends into psychosis becoming convinced that his mission in life is to battle scum on the street nhe purchases formidable arsenal of guns and begins physical preparations for the inevitable conflict nthat conflict finally comes when he takes personal interest in iris jodie foster 12 year old prostitute who temporarily took refuge in his taxi nas many great movies that got cult status through the years taxi driver became the object of many interpretations nfor some critics and scholars it is an exploration of universal subjects that date back to dostoyevski loss of moral compass in bleak reality of dirty overpopulated industrial cities the story could have been set in 19th century same as in our times nfor others the movie uses raskolnikov like figure in order to portray burning problems of 1970s america its apparent inability to deal with the consequences of rapid social changes that occurred in previous decade nbrilliant performance of robert de niro in role of lifetime can give arguments for both sides nhis travis bickle has lot in common with most of the average viewers of today many of us share his feelings of isolation loneliness and outrage towards crime drugs prostitution and senseless street violence nhis pathetic attempts to establish some kind of human connection with the people around him sometimes in most unusual circumstances like with secret service agents pimps or job interviewers make him person too goofy to be the hero and too pathetic to be the classic villain nhowever most of the average viewers are sensible enough to recognise the tin line that separate concerned citizens or troubled souls from fanatical madmen nbut despite anything average viewer at the end actually cheers for travis his crusade against scum is something that average person wants but doesn have stomach lack of brains to do it nwhile de niro travis might come in and out of particular times and places other persons that appear in the film mostly played by the character actors give it distinctively 1970s feel nwizzard played by peter boyle presents the only link with america better past but only because he is the oldest taxi driver in company and therefore everybody assumes that he knows stuff nhis obvious inadequacy in giving advice to troubled travis illustrates the inability of pre 1960s generations to find answers to the problems of gloomy decade nother characters on the other hand show the bad side of new age nmatthew sport keitel who befriended real life pimps in other to prepare for his role of lifetime is dressed like hippie iris found excuse for her escape to the world of drugs and child prostitution in ideology of counterculture nporno movies that should be the element of new times of sexual freedom are too much even for supposedly liberated betsy neven the politicians like senator palantine are lost in post vietnam and post watergate mess his broad and senseless messages that cover the lack of any serious program can fool even such idiots like travis nthe past is gone the present is bad and even the future seems bleak and the feeling of pessimism can be washed away even by ironic happy end ntravis and his world found themselves in desperate situation and martin scorsese uses the best of his cinematic skills in order to spill the gloom of schrader screenplay into the silver screen nnew york city in the night is portrayed as hell on earth and the red light and steam coming out of sewers give it surreal almost stygian atmosphere nanother important element of the atmosphere is score of great bernard herrman whose efficient use of jazz elements gives some melancholy that softens the brutality of motion picture none of the greatest ironies of taxi driver is the fact that the movie was same as his protagonist famous for the wrong reason ninstead of receiving cult status because of his artistic merits for many years it was tabloid fodder because of hinckley and his real life re enactment of events in the movie nnow more than two decades later when some other life imitating art incidents get more attention we can finally enjoy taxi driver in all its artistic glory ',\n",

              " 'the thought provoking question of tradition over morals is the subject directly at the core of leila powerfully articulated and subtle drama from famous iranian director dariush mehrjui that is his first motion picture in prosperous thirty year career to gain s distribution thanks to first run features nalthough unfamiliar with mehrjui previous directing efforts perhaps the reason for this is that while the predicament at hand is no doubt exclusive to its own country the heartbreaking and solely truthful emotions of the characters can easily be understood by all viewers nset in modern day iran leila begins on the birthday of the title character leila hatami after brief prologue in which we are shown the first encounter between leila and her future husband reza ali mosaffa nas leila and reza set off to visit his parents and then hers where birthday celebration has been planned things seem rosy for the couple on the outside but for leila life isn quite as sweet nearlier on that very same day leila had gone to see her physician and has ultimately discovered that she holds very little chance of ever conceiving child nwhen all of the conditions are ruled out and leila passes up the possibility of adoption reza firmly and lovingly tells her that he married her and doesn care at all about having children nnonetheless leila is ashamed that she will never be able to give him baby which is the societal norm and her self esteem is not helped at all by her domineering mother in law jamileh sheikhi whose hopes to carry on the sacred family name vanishes once hearing the news reza is her only son nbluntly explaining to leila that reza has always wished for children and in country where polygamy is an accepted tradition she suggests that he take second wife to bear child with nleila hesitantly agrees and while she and reza are able to shallowly laugh afterwards about the hopeful womens inadequacies reza finally does meet woman whom he claims to like even though he refuses to go through with the marriage if leila doesn give her full blessing nthere are no easy answers to be found within leila film that thoughtfully examines the central character unfortunate plight as well as the inner workings of leila herself told through matter of fact narration nalmost completely taken over by her own shame she has no option but to agree to her forceful mother in law requests even though she is unsure of how she will react if reza really does end up marrying another woman nmaybe because leila is from iran the film will unquestionably be shocking for american audiences since the concept of polygamy is looked upon by the characters as more or less everyday occurrence nleila however is unable to come to terms with the idea quite as easily but feels it is her duty to make her husband happy no matter what the circumstances none of the strongest aspects of the film is in its portrayal of the relationship between leila and reza who married only three months after their first meeting but obviously love each other very deeply nit is this relationship that is the key ingredient to making what follows the opening scenes all the more powerful and director mehrjui has succeeded just about as well as possible nalthough seemingly unimportant at first glance an early sequence where leila and reza are eating dinner and both are laughing nearly uncontrollably actually is one of the most vital moments in the first half as it unmistakably sets the boundary for their unrequisite love for one another nditto for another scene in which reza gives leila large stuffed animal for her birthday and then reveals beautiful necklace he has also gotten her nthese small moments are the perfect contrast for the solemn outraging sequences in the latter half in which reza drops leila off at the side of busy road and then zooms off to go on date with another woman nleft there to ponder her quickly diminishing marriage foolishly unbeknownst to reza leila prays each time that the date will not go well so she will be able to keep her husband to herself for little while longer nrefusing to stay over at her parent house the film inevitably leads up to the second wedding night between reza and another woman and in sequence of extraordinary sorrow and potency leila finds her whole being emotionally torn apart as she is closed up in an upstairs bedroom as the marriage proceedings are going on down below ndespite her initial agreement to such thing leila realizes how much she has been betrayed by reza whom she believed cared for her as much as she did of him nsure the whole second marriage was his mother idea but if he really did believe what he initially had told her about not wanting any children then he could have still easily backed out couldn he nin the pivotal role of leila who appears in every scene leila hatami is nothing short of remarkable injecting her character with an equal measure of startling strength unavoidable vulnerability and utter despair nunlike most american films in which everything always has to be spelled out for audiences hatami says much more with just an elusive expression on her face than could possibly have been conveyed by words nevery bit perfect match for hatami is ali mosaffa as reza man who believe does hold an unbreakable bond with his wife but is too naive to realize what he will be doing to leila if he marries someone else nfor all of its strong aspects leila isn a perfect film non technical level found many blatant punctiation and spelling mistakes within the subtitles that need to be fixed nand concerning the plot developments the final five minutes ring false when compared with everything that has come before nmehrjui decision to use an extremely stylized approach to the ending was the wrong choice particularly in his almost comedic way of wrapping up the character of the spiteful mother in law played memorably by jamileh sheikhi ndespite these minor missteps leila is an important motion picture that should definately be sought out upon its limited may 16 release at new york cinema village and then on may 21 in la nthe thought provoking questions that the film deals with is balanced evenly with its uneasy morales and when the climax arrives leila self worth is startlingly stripped away to reveal victim led into complete devastation to which there is no return nit difficult to not consider how leila culminating interior demise could have been so simply avoided had the other characters taken second out of their own selfish lives to consider what leila the major pawn in the unforgivable scheme was going through ',\n",

is now one of today most bankable stars nbruce willis proved his acting chops and is now considered an actual actor njackie brown on the other hand boasts quite well known cast except for the main lead pam grier nmost likely you have heard of her and seen her in films but she never really had breakthrough performance her first film was in the roger ebert written beyond the valley of the dolls nthat is until now njackie brown is highly anticipated feature film from quentin tarantino whose last film was the huge hit pulp fiction nafter mediocre acting jobs tarantino returns to what made his name household one directing and writing njackie brown is the result and it is fantastic entertainment ndespite excellent direction from tarantino the cast steals the film giving one good performance after another npam grier gives stunning performance as jackie brown and she is supported by an incredible mix of talent samuel jackson bridget fonda michael keaton robert de niro and robert forster nmore than likely you will see few of these names in the oscar pool come oscar nominations ndescribing quentin tarantino film is very difficult as you really can say much or you spoil it for everyone else ni will tread lightly njackie brown opens with an impressive shot of jackie brown grier in blue outfit walking through the airport nthe camera tracks along with her and ends up revealing her occupation nwe are also introduced to ordell robbie jackson who sells illegal guns to interested buyers nfor hefty price nms brown carries the money from buyer to ordell in order to keep the cops away nhowever an fbi agent keaton and local a cop michael bowen are out to find ordell and catch him while taking the money nthey try to reach him through beaumont livingston chris tucker one of ordell buyers but he mysteriously ends up dead nthey try again through brown but she is hesitant to admit to any wrong doing nbut after unknowingly carrying some drugs for one of ordell friends fonda she is caught and sent to jail nordell pays her bail through bail bond agent max cherry forster and then wants to find out what she told the cops nafter she claims to have said nothing she reveals the fact that she will tell them about ordell in order to stay out of prison nordell doesn like this but they both come up with scheme to throw the feds and cops off their track nthis scheme seems to be going as planned but unexpected occurances may or may not foul up their goal nrevealing more would spoil the fun of jackie brown and that the biggest reason to go see tarantino film ntarantino seems to have fascination with hitmen and unusual predicaments and slang terms but they are always done very well and believably nhis hitmen are normally cruel but pleasant in that nasty sort of way nthey talk like normal people except for when doing business and they are rude to their girlfriends nof course this is tarantino film and you know you can expect some awkward situations to arise nand perhaps the biggest flaw with jackie brown is the slow middle section in which the pace begins to drop nof course tarantino fixes this by moving onto the climax of the film adding lot of his reservoir dogs style storytelling to it nthings are told from one person perspective and then from another and then from another each time learning more and more nthis all leads up to very interesting conclusion which decides who is on whose side non the technical side of jackie brown quentin tarantino directs it with the same style as he did with his 1994 film nhowever this time around it isn as nearly as impressive or original nthe writing on the other hand is quite good although do find tarantino use of slang terms offensive nthe story jumps back and forth in time as in pulp fiction but it much more easy to understand nhis previous film needed second viewing in order to understand the time differentiation but jackie brown is very simply to follow especially considering that the time is given during the leaps in time nperhaps this is result of the screenplay being written from the novel rum punch by elmore leonard nthe dialogue is pretty much intelligent and all the characters are fully realized nthe cinematography is very well done by guillermo navarro who has worked with tarantino on previous films and the editing is very good nand as with pulp fiction the music is highlight bringing back memorable songs from the 70s and 80s nthe acting side of jackie brown is unforgettable nthe performances are incredibly rich with hidden meaning behind every characters actions nnothing is quite as it seems and you can really tell which side one person is on nthe real treat of course is pam grier who gives an astonishing performance as jackie brown nher poor living conditions are superceded by her superior wits which play an important role in the film nwatching grieg could tell what was going through her mind even if didn know what she was thinking nher face portrays lot of emotion that you can tell when she is sad happy or in deep thought nbridget fonda gives very good performance as druggie couch potato ni didn even realize it was fonda until saw her name in the final credits her performance actually reminded me of heather graham in boogie nights nmichael keaton comes across very well as does michael bowen nchris tucker has small but effective performance nsamuel jackson is very good but it seems to me that he was replaying his jules winnfield character from pulp fiction although much less cynical nbut no matter njackson is very strong in his role nrobert de niro is actually little annoying at times but overall he does good job as one of ordell perspective clients and friends nrobert forster gives one of the best performances in the film as he has one of the most developed characters nhe is present throughout most of the film and he holds his own against jackson and grier njackie brown is rated for language sex violence drug use and some offensive remarks nas film by itself jackie brown is terrific piece of entertainment with complex plot to draw viewers in nhowever one can not help but compare it to tarantino pulp fiction and expect great results nwhen compared it comes up short but not that short nit a worthy effort with terrific acting and some impressive writing from elmore leonard and tarantino nperhaps the best thing about jackie

most enjoy nsome scoff the idea but everyone who gazes into the complexity of the spinning object winds up seeing something different than the next revealing personality traits which the person may not have known they had before nthis can easily stand as model for chocolat as whole on the surface it appears to be light fluffy fable with no depth or true worth but when one takes second deeper look chocolat true colors begin to shine through nmaking bold statement about organized religion and those who practice it lasse hallstrom chocolat is flawlessly acted and meticulously crafted not to mention one of the best films of the year nwhat gives chocolat its magic much like hallstrom 1999 winner of two academy awards the cider house rules is its willingness to say what on its mind without holding back to prevent offending audiences nthe bold and honest message hallstrom conveys with chocolat will no doubt outrage select group of viewers but those who are willing to suspend their bitterness because they feel they are being intimidated or attacked should find themselves to be in agreement with what the film says about narrow mindedness nchocolat centers its story around the small french village of lansquenet where majority rules and the majority lives by only one law religion nthe bulk of the townspeople with few exceptions are preparing for the sacred time of abstinence lent but when the independent thinking seemingly non religious vianne rocher juliette binoche and her daughter anouk victoire thivisol make the village their home the people will be tempted beyond belief by the mouth watering confections in the chocolate shop vianne opens nmany are predictably opposed and deeply offended by vianne opening of the chocolate shop just in time for lent especially the mayor comte de reynaud cartoon like alfred molina who will stop at nothing to put her out of business non the other hand the shop is delight to others including the cranky armande voizin judi dench who sits day by day in vianne shop telling the single mother about her unfortunate detached relationship with her grandson aurelien parent koening which comes as result of his mother carrie ann moss believing armande is bad influence as she does not hold the same strict religious beliefs that she does nalso fan of the chocolate is the nervous wreck josephine muscat whose husband is constantly beating her to whom vianne offers home and befriends njuliette binoche is charming and honest as vianne genuinely capturing her character determination to turn the narrow minded townspeople into more happy independent human beings but most of chocolat success is unquestionably result of the remarkable performances of the supporting actresses nlena olin previously nominated for an oscar in 1989 deserves her second nomination for her earnest moving portrayal of lost scared woman torn between staying true to her battering manipulative husband or leaving him to live the life which for which she longs njudi dench is sharp incisive and occasionally greatly touching as armande voizin ncarrie ann moss in what is likely to be her first largely noticed and acclaimed role since the matrix shows more solid side of her acting skills not previously seen crafting character that the viewer both sympathizes with and despises simultaneously nvictoire thivisol shows much promise as anouk young girl hoping her always on the move mother will eventually settle down na trade ad for chocolat sums up best the power the actresses have on screen with the tagline five extraordinary women one extraordinary movie nthat not to say the men don do their share though alfred molina makes for sly and utterly repugnant antagonist hugh conor adds quite bit of comic relief as the priest who seems to not even know why he is who he is and johnny depp gives strong performance as the pirate roux who enters the film late in the game and sparks the romantic interest of vianne nthe technical aspects of chocolat are strong across the board lasse hallstrom directs his enchanting fable with great care perfectly balancing the elements of each genre to be found within the film ncinematographer roger pratt brings an atmospheric fairy tale look to the film and rachel portman masterful score is her best and most memorable since the cider house rules nchocolat adapted by robert nelson jacobs from the joanne harris novel is wonderful little treat of film one that will most likely win over the hearts of audiences and the votes of academy members this winter and the aggressive backing of miramax films assures the latter nwhile not as powerful as the cider house rules lasse hallstrom chocolat is film which works on all levels as drama comedy fable romance and fairy tale nand it even lives up to its name it is delicious to savor the taste of easy to digest and like all excellent chocolate it is memorable for days afterward nthe bottom line chocolat is pure pleasure ',\n",

              " 'in the wake of the smashing success of rumble in the bronx it looking more and more likely that more jackie chan films will see american release nrumor has it that one of these films will be drunken master ii nthe version have is copy from the laserdisc it widescreen and bilingually subtitled as are most hong kong films these days navailability over here in the united states is very limited these films must either be purchased via pirates or sought out from asian distributors such as tai seng nthe subtitling on the copy have is slightly hard to read the letters are white and bit small nalthough the american release will almost certainly be dubbed this review is of the subtitled version so please keep that in mind if you re reading this review to help you decide whether to go out and see it nto be fair must admit that ve never been very fond of period piece martial arts movies the ones set in some nebulous china of the distant or not so distant past nperhaps it because most of those ve seen were filmed on inferior stock with either butchered dubbing or all but illegible subtitling or perhaps it because their plots all tend to be very similar to each other and in many cases all but nonexistant nin fact many of them get so wrapped up in their subplots that they seem to forget their main plot entirely until only few minutes before the end nor for that matter it might be because the jackie chan films with more modern settings armour of god rumble in the bronx etc tend to have more spectacular stunts often involving large motor vehicles and large explosions whereas period pieces simply have the martial arts nhaving said that must now turn right around and say that drunken master ii is remarkable exception to all or most of the above is one of the better martial arts films ve seen and quite enjoyed it nsurprised nwell so was ndrunken master ii is about young man named wong fei hong played by jackie chan who is master of the drunken boxing style of kung fu nwhere he learned this style is uncertain as his father wong kei ying ti lung is steadfast in his opposition to fei hong practicing it rather than some more normal style of kung fu napparently fei hong is some sort of figure from chinese folklore rather like paul bunyan is for americans but ve heard very little about this and could quite well be wrong so ll leave analysis of that to the people who know it better none of my friends points out that the character of wong fei hong is also featured in the once upon time in china movies but have not yet seen those nthe plot of drunken master ii is somewhat hazy as are the plots to many such films but if you re watching jackie chan film odds are you aren expecting something on the order of war and peace nthe story seems to revolve around those evil foreigners who are spiriting away ancient chinese relics and hence china cultural heritage while overworking underpaying and beating up chinese workers in nearby steel mill nhowever this plot merely serves as framework for the other main story of the film fei hong perpetual struggle to win his girlfriend supplicate his father keep his pregnant mother played by anita mui from fighting and keep from getting beaten up by evil foreigner thugs nthe macguffin that drives the plot is precious antique jade imperial seal which is being taken away by the evil foreigners nin the beginning fei hong accidentally steals it while trying to recover an identically wrapped box containing the medicinal ginseng his father was bringing back for customer nin the process he clashes with another thief who is himself trying for the seal but ends up instead with the ginseng nafter fei hong narrowly avoids getting caught with the seal by the evil foreigners lackies thanks to some timely intervention by general son cameo appearance by andy lau who would later take on the starring role in drunken master iii comedic chaos ensues back at the wong household when fei hong and his mother attempt to come up with replacement for the missing ginseng nand so it goes nand the plot thickens later on such as when fei hong girlfriend maneuvers him into kung fu match with rival or when fei hong and the thief now revealed to be loyalist manchu officer trying to recover the seal and stop the evil foreigners are attacked en masse another grand kung fu movie tradition but think ve already spent more time on the plot than it really deserves nlet move on to the real draw of jackie chan movies the naction nthere plenty of martial arts action to be found in this movie of ncourse in kung fu film that to be expected nhowever this isn just another kung fu movie this one has jackie chan doing the fight and stunt choreography and jackie chan is genius nthe primary martial arts style featured in the film is drunken boxing form of kung fu which attempts to draw the adversary off his guard by making it seem like the fellow using it is drunk nfurther for the purposes of this film at least drunken boxers fight better when they actually _are_ intoxicated but nthere a fine line between just drunk enough and drunk into stupor nunder normal circumstances the idea of someone staggering around looking sloshed but managing to fight effectively and even incredibly might seem rather stupid but jackie pulls it off with flair nthe kung fu sequences are so intricate in their staging and execution that it is pointless to try to describe it on paper so ll just say that the fights especially the big climactic fight at the end in themselves make the movie worth watching nanother thing drunken master ii has going for it is the stunt work neven without motor vehicles well not counting train there are some remarkable stunts in this film namong other things jackie dives off balcony into table and crawls across hot coals not once but at _least_ twice if you count the outtake shown during the credits quicktime movies of these stunts can be found through the www movie database nunlike in american films these stunts are _not_ faked ndrunken master ii stars several veteran actors of the hong kong movie scene including jackie ti lung better tomorrow 1 2 and anita mui the heroic trio series rumble in the bronx nthe performances are first rate especially when it comes to the comedy parts of the film nthe scene where fei hong and his mother conspire literally behind fei hong father back to cover up for the missing ginseng root is hilarious as is the scene where fei hong mother having just revealed that she is pregnant is threatening to hurt herself in order to draw her husband anger away from fei hong njackie has developed his knack for physical comedy into sort of mastery over the years and he in fine form all through drunken master ii nas far as cinematography is concerned it certainly works for this film nit nothing spectacular but is at least dozen times better than all those old kung fu movies of the 70s nthe picture is crisp and clear none thing find particularly worthy of mention is that at least in the copy have the screen was wider than any film ve ever seen on videotape before almost whole 1 3 of the screen was blocked out above and below watch this on bigscreen tv or movie theater if you can nit will be an utter shame if this film is eventually pan and scanned for american video release ndrunken master ii shows the full potential of

one of the characters have bowel movement but then that would have made them believable ngodzilla for the most part is okay nthe design of the beast is funky if not very memorable none thing that comes to mind the major redirection of godzilla in this film is to remove his most familiar trademark namely his atomic breath nnow for one can quite fathom how you can call this monster godzilla without that little trait na good comparison would be to make superman film and eliminate his ability to fly nthere is so much wrong with this film that can really recall anything recently that has left me this cold hearted except for my divorce nany film that can have two ton lizard slipping on gum balls has got to be envisioned under the influence of prozac nthe addition of the baby raptors ah meant godzillas are nothing but direct rip off of jurassic park but with none of that film suspense or tension nsuffice to say that godzilla is without doubt the most brain dead motion picture of the decade nthis is film that needed the hype nwith the current level of writing and directing nothing else about the film succeeds nif you ve seen the trailers you ve seen the best parts nmy only

serial killer named carl stargher vincent onofrio has been kidnapping women locking them in an automated cell that drowns them slowly in matter of days then soaking the corpses in bleach to turn them into life sized dolls njust after kidnapping his latest victim and locking her in the cell stargher has traumatic experience that triggers schizophrenic virus in his brain and causes him to sink in an eternal catatonia nthe police led by fbi agent peter novak vince vaughn are able to locate stargher by some clues he left while dumping his previous victim body but they feel all hope is lost for his current victim due to his vegetative state nin last ditch attempt they ask deane and the scientists that created the project to undergo the frightening task of entering stargher mind to try and find the location of the victim locked in the deadly cell na cell which will completely fill with water in the next 40 hours ninitial reports about this film described it as cross between the silence of the lambs and the matrix nwhile it does share some characteristics with both films particularly the first forty minutes which seem almost like condensed version of lambs the cell also seems to contain elements of dreamscape and brainstorm nthe buzz around this project is that first time feature film director tarsem singh who won many awards for his video of e s losing my religion wanted script that he could fashion images out of instead of cohesive story and good portion of this film supports that theory ndespite the borrowed elements from the aforementioned films and script that contains several logically questionable moments the cell does feature some remarkable imagery nall of the sequences where we delve into someone mind are incredibly beautiful including the dank mind of stargher whose thoughts are reminiscent of an r giger painting come to life mixed with tool music video proving that singh is as adept at filming strange and wonderful images as his acclaim would lead us to believe nthe first sequence that takes place in stargher mind is by far the best featuring one of the most ingenious traps ve ever seen in film involving horse which no one seeing this film will probably forget zoo like display of stargher victims which are animated like marionettes and stargher himself in giant purple cape that spans the walls of his mental throne room nif the film had continued within this dirty monstrous world would have deemed the film brilliant but alas the sequences only become more silly as they go along despite painful nipple ring removal later in the film nthe cast is basically just an excuse for there to be some moderate plot semblance during the parade of images but at least vincent onofrio turns in his usual bizarre and psychotic performance magnified by ten thanks to the environment in which the film has been placed nin my opinion onofrio was one of the best creepy actors have ever seen in film but his film choices as of late have been so completely awful e nthe newton boys feeling minnesota the thirteenth floor and the velocity of gary that have begun to rethink my initial assessment of him nthe character of stargher is an excellent role for him though and will probably lead to bit of typecasting for him ndetractors of violence and disturbing images will want to stay far away from this film as it contains heavy doses of both nbesides the nipple ring removal mention above there is also stargher penchant for hanging suspended off of the floor by the rings that pierce his back and legs prior to his catatonia and capture which will have audiences recoiling na sequence where catherine enters stargher mind and finds him recreating the disemboweling of his first victim is also pretty disquieting none moment also features character having his intestines slowly removed from his body by an old fashioned hand cranked spit like device nas narrative film the cell is sorely lacking nas collection of images though the cell is extremely well done nalthough the latter sequences in the film contain fewer disturbing imagery than the first half singh has done what he supposedly set out to do make film solely for the purpose of stringing some remarkable images together nunfortunately well written script should have been considered too because without it the cell just seems like any other music video we could see on mtv provided of course that mtv allowed for the use of graphic violence and language in music videos ',\n",

              " 'seen may 19 1999 at 5 m at the crossgates cinema 18 guilderland y theater 1 with my brother john for 8 50 theater rating excellent seats sound and picture critic note this review is the longest ve ever written and still only scratches the surface ni recommend this be read only by those who have seen the film as form of critical analysis nas my friend and fellow film critic ted prigge said in his review of the phantom menace how do even write this review nnever mind the fact that ve been waiting for new star wars movie since was seven years old nnever mind the fact everyone on the internet had already dissected and discussed the movie before it was even released nnever mind that there so much going on in this movie in terms of plot action special effects and long term story that to analyze every aspect would take lot of time and energy and still wouldn cover everything nand also like ted does in all of his reviews ll try to review this in way different from my usual reviews and instead write as casually as possible as if was talking directly to you the reader nbefore we can begin analyzing the specific aspects of the film many of the most general and most significant factors must be considered to get the specifics of the film skip this and the next four paragraphs nas has been made obvious for the last several years another trilogy of films will be produced to account for the missing initial three installments of the star wars series the first of the films was actually episode four not one ngeorge lucas the creator of the series has probably just assumed most people know the first produced trilogy star wars the empire strikes back and return of the jedi is actually the second trilogy chronologically nin media interviews in the past he has explained why the movies were made out of order but can recall his reasons nwith this new film he as writer and director has also assumed viewers are at least vaguely familiar with the storylines and significant plot points of the first trilogy err nsecond trilogy nwell you know what mean nand in order for this review to be thorough many of those significant points must be mentioned which unfortunately may serve as spoilers so proceed with caution critic note 1 it is one my personal policy not to intentionally analyze spoilers because would like my reviews to be able to make sense to the reader both before and after viewing the film reviewed but it would be nearly impossible to do the film justice here without breaking the rule ncritic note 2 reviewing this film also breaks the universal critics law of reviewing movies which as roger ebert coined it not what movie is about but how it is about it nbecause so many outside factors come into play in the film plot and significance as part of trilogy and just considering modern society it again would be difficult if not impossible to simply review the film as completely autonomous story nfirst of all we have to catalog what we know about the film before even going into it nwe know that young anakin skywalker will grow up to become the evil ruler darth vader who is also the father of luke skywalker who will lead successful revolution against him and his empire nwe know obi wan ben kenobi was the trainer of anakin in the ways of the force in attempts to become jedi knight but would fail and thus anakin would fall to the dark side nwe also know something about the force itself that it is some kind of universal force which determines fate and can be manipulated by those whose minds are expanded enough to believe in it and feel it the jedi nwhat we don know for sure is the history of the ruling of the galaxy which is most likely much longer and more complex than any government we have had here on earth nto me this was one of the most fascinating aspects of the first three films because there seemed to be subtle definite order to all the complexity nalso it seems that we re supposed to be familiar with few other details about the story which have come out of the thousands of comic books and paperbacks published in the years since the movies ended nmost notably details regarding the emperor from empire and jedi and that he was once senator and his last name is palpatine nfor those who haven kept up with all the star wars paraphernalia over the years there is still way to know these details simply by recognizing an actor or his voice at least nwith the phantom menace being the first chapter of long saga one would assume the basic groundwork would be laid including the history behind all the major factors of the series especially the force and the jedi knights nunfortunately this film does more of the opposite as it simply builds on top of what must be history so long and detailed it could never be explained ni didn liked that aspect to this film and is one of the reasons it falls just short of greatness nif you re going to tell story from the beginning tell it from the beginning is it possible that after this trilogy is complete there could be another trilogy of episodes 1 through 3 to clarify the back story even further nbut digress ni ve said so much and yet haven even touched on the specifics of the film itself nall these necessary disclaiming elements should go to show just how vast the story of the star wars series is and this individual film itself nwhat we get here is movie not unlike any of the other three we ve come to know and love since the late 1970s nits similarity to the other films helps to keep the spirit of the series familiar but at the same time seems to be flaw in the filmmaking process itself since it sometimes rings of unoriginality nthe basic story is rather sorted complex and even confusing at times nwe re told that an army known as the trade federation has set up blockade around an seemingly insignificant planet called naboo nwe re not given too many details to clarify the back story of what the federation is and what their purpose is instead the film opts to get its story moving quickly nwe re introduced to two jedi the master qui gon jinn neeson and his apprentice obi wan kenobi mcgregor nthe two are acting as ambassadors of some sort in hopes of ending the obvious hostility between the federation and the planet queen amidala portman nthe leader of the federation an alien called viceroy is following the orders of strange mythical character an older human man whose face and body are covered and shadowed by the black robe and hood he wears nhe is referred to as lord sidious but considering his appearance and especially that creepy evil voice of his he is obviously one of the most significant characters in the series nsidious communicates to viceroy only through digital transmissions and never in person nclearly his actual whereabouts are something he wants to keep secret because that would also reveal his identity which is never openly revealed in the film but should be clear to most viewers ni have feeling we ll delve into his background in the next two films nbut it doesn take the film long to spring into action and within minutes our hero jedi are fighting for their lives and the film story begins to move along nthe film doesn have one specific plot and works in the same manner as the other films in the series where as what we get is one mini plot and adventure on top of another nthere are so many of these mini plots within plots in this film would not describe them all because it is what gives the movie its hook nthe other films have relied on this type of storytelling but because of the limits of the technology at the time the films screenplays were also limiting nthe sense of limitlessness here is what gives the phantom menace its unique traits nas we already know the film takes place at least generation or two before the original star wars trilogy which means lot of the background which was unclear and or unexplained may be cleared up here as it is the beginning of the vast epic story nand here the most significant storyline is that involving the discovery of 10 year old anakin skywalker lloyd by qui gon jinn and his introduction to the jedi council nto briefly summarize the story jinn stumbles upon skywalker in an attempt to buy parts for queen amidala spaceship which was damaged in efforts to free her from the federation ntheir meeting on tatooine is mostly chance but of course jinn chalks it up to the will of the force njinn can feel that skywalker has great natural power in the force and through another sub plot involving bet on skywalker in fantastic race he will enter more and more details of his significance begin to reveal themselves nthis also provides for new elaboration and explanation of the force which has never been mentioned before nin fact it seems to be something so important it is upsetting it has never been mentioned before nthe element seriously undermines the mystical aspect of the force and transforms it into something more physical and scientific which is completely unnecessary nby the film third act all the major significant elements become tied together in rather familiar execution of the plot nit funny how the reality of the star wars world seems so embedded in mythology new age like philosophy and religion and yet the solution to all the major conflicts in the series has been violence nnot that this technique hasn been used in movies and in real life situations countless times throughout history nand at least it all in the spirit of the ultimate powers of good versus evil in fun and exciting matter nit does border of the cartoonish sometimes but that just the film appealing to our inner child which is the basic reason the entire saga exists and has become such big part of our modern society the phantom menace delivers exactly what you expect from star wars film which is why it succeeds as well as it does but is always why it never truly achieves greatness nso many things in the film we ve seen before and done with more heart because the filmmakers concentrated just bit more on story and character because they were limited nbut this film is far from bad because it at least embraces the spirit of sheer fun at the movies ',\n",

picture nyou see patch adams revolted me beyond all boundaries ni hated this movie for every second that sat watching it and actively hate it now days later with the simpering superficial nauseatingly sentimental images forever plaguing my memories ni hate every element of the film beginning with tom shadyac shameless direction and all the way up to the misguided and mishandled themes that the screenplay wants so desperately to convey nthe badness of patch adams is stupefying nit confounding ni can believe film can be this bad nand yet it based on real man who probably has good point to make nin the film patch is played by the undefeatable and indefatigable robin williams in performance of such insulting pathos and sledgehammer sympathy that wonder now if he is even human nin the beginning of the film patch commits himself to mental institution because he doesn want to kill himself nwhile there he notices that the doctors don care about the patients and that the best way to get through to the patients is to treat them like human beings nso patch goes on crusade to be great doctor who actually talks to his patients nhe goes to medical school where he meets truman daniel london and convinces him that it good to help people nhe also meets carin fischer monica potters the anti male med student who just wants to go through the motions and be successful doctor nnaturally the dean of the medical school bob gunton hates patch and wants to thwart his plans even though patch gets the highest scores on all of his exams nso patch decides that he going to build free clinic in the middle of nowhere to help people with any problem they may have nand that my friends is the synopsis for what is easily the most abhorrent picture of 1998 non superficial level the film is not particularly bad wouldn say the cinematography bothered me and most of the performances seem to be exactly what shadyac was aiming for actually liked potter performance even if she is wasted nbut the film fails fundamentally in execution nevery scene swells with grand emotional music played at maximum volume just to get us all to cry real hard ntake for instance the first scene which shows patch sitting on bus nwe don know patch yet but there sad music and it supposed to make us really sad that he sad nlater on patch makes lot of progress he helps dying patient peter coyote to enjoy the last days of his life and the music as patch is pushing the patient recklessly through the halls of the hospital is very lively nand when that patient finally dies spoiler alert the music is very very sad nbut the problem with all of this is that the music should not be the center of the emotions nreal drama is character based nyou grow to like someone and then something bad happens and you feel it nwe don ever grow to know the dying patient he simply vehicle for patch greatness nreal drama doesn seem forced or present just to make the audience cry nthat why patch adams is not real drama nit goes for every cheap tear imaginable wringing tired and overbearing sentimentality out of every scene neven scenes that have very little impact on the overall film are drowning in marc shaiman sickening musical score nsentimentality like this is indeed bad nbut it not as bad as half baked simplistic themes nyou see patch is really great student nhe aces his tests without studying and does it so effectively that people think he cheating nbut patch doesn think that memorizing facts is the way to become good doctor why don we see patients until the third year he bursts out every three seconds nwell patch that might have something to do with the fact that you need to learn something before you go treating patients nnot everyone has the capability of memorizing facts with no effort nmost of us have to study nand doctor who really wants to help but doesn know toe from finger probably won be too successful in preventing death noh wait almost forgot the point of doctors is not just to prevent death but to improve the quality of life nyes nthat is true nand you can not do that without studying nyou can not do that without going to medical school nwhat patch never seemed to understand was the possibility that maybe just maybe it is good idea to study first and talk to patients later nfollow the rules nbah nwho needs the rules nonly uptight doctors follow the rules nthe real saviors are the ones running around the hospitals with big red spheres on their faces and sporting baggy yellow pants nand then there the free clinic issue which find shockingly frighteningly idealistic na free clinic nin the middle of the forest nwhere patients can be taken to be helped nfor free nhow will patients be transported to the free clinic nwill it have an emergency room nor is it just for mental patients nand who may ask will pay for it nthe film does give some token attempts to question patch motives think another character asks him how he going to pay for it in addition to little bit of meaningless blather about hmos and medical insurance but they certainly don explore or challenge patch ideas to any meaningful extent nreader please understand this am not making any kind of judgment on the real patch adams ni know nothing about him nif his beliefs mirror those of this film character then might like to have an intelligent discussion with him about them nbut regardless of what the real patch adams believes the themes put forth in this film are simplistic and phony nand in the last scene the big obligatory courtroom scene that forced my lunch halfway up my

appealing presence in movies nshe proved quite charming as the intelligent astronomer in the romantic comedy roxanne and equally creepy as pris in the sci fi classic blade runner nthe clan of the cave bear clearly tries to capitalize on hannah as selling point the poster art bears striking closeup of hannah in tribal paint and the video box prominently features her name in lettering the same size as the title nnot even her starring role in this turkey unfortunately can save it from being an unbelievable exercise in cheese nit so uniquely bad film dealing with prehistoric man that actually tries and miserably fails to be serious that it oddly fascinating nthe ridiculous attempt at drama here leaves the audience somehow transfixed wanting to see how this dud plays out nthe clan of the

the so called dirty parts blacked out with marker by her grandmother ni have never read this book but sure hope it 10 000 times better than its film adaptation nif not then m at complete loss to explain its popularity nthe clan of the cave bear immediately opens with comically absurd scene na young ayla looking much like drew barrymore in t ntramps about in the woods nwith her cute little ponytails and fur wrapped about her the audience expectations of convincing portrayal of prehistory are immediately shattered nwhat follows is laughably choreographed sequence in which an earthquake swallows up ayla mother blonde with fur pants er nleggings ntearful ayla looks on as the cameraman shakes the camera well nas the earthquake slowly recedes na hungry lion becomes interested in her for lunch but the screaming six year old manages to outrun the king of the wild and find safe haven ni won detail the story any further this seems enough to illustrate my point nthis movie is really stupid nit never even gives the audience chance to suspend their disbelief nalso the obvious comparison between the appearance of cro magnon man in prehistory and the rise of feminism in our century is about as subtle as burning wonderbra in front of charlton heston nthe movie doesn just suggest this message it whacks the message into the audience with two by four na blond gorgeous woman challenges the social laws of bunch of people in gaudy brown wigs nshe of the new people they re of the old people with the memories nyep nwe get it nwe get it nthe clan of the cave bear apparently received an academy award nomination for best make up which surprises me nthe movie depends upon lot of make up obviously but much of it is unconvincing nas stated before daryl hannah is daryl hannah here she looks like she just stepped out of the shower all the time nthe rest of the characters have dark make up of some sort smeared over them to look like dirt nthe face painting that occasionally seen is perhaps the only notable work here in my mind nthis movie also suffers from its new age trappings nmaybe the music sounded lot more fresh or original during 1985 but now it sounds dated and cliched like poorly conceived elevator music nadd to this the film faux mysticism including spirit animals and dream visions and narrator who sounds like psychic you expect to hear on 1 900 number and you get movie that has serious problems being serious nthe clan of the cave bear is rated though it probably one of the most inoffensive offensive films ve seen in quite while nit contains several scenes of sex sans nudity nthe violence mostly consists of hunting scenes nthe funniest moment of the movie occurs when neanderthal in love with ayla attempts to rescue her from ferocious bear nthe bear bites his head off and the audience sees it rolling about nalthough this may sound gratuitous m sure it so cheesy that it probably won bother most people nthe clan of the cave bear is bad movie

dinosaurs who did not exist at the same time as man and raquel welch come to mind nthe clan of the cave bear tries so hard to be serious that though it so bad the audience is still interested by the unique setting and characters of the movie which is why awarded this turkey two stars ni have to think that fans of the book would be disappointed with this film version however m only basing this

kind of movie that reduces you to childish expressions like that was the funnest movie ve ever seen nso to hell with webster chicken run is one of the funnest movies ve seen in while ni can remember the last time ve seen anything funner nthe chickens at tweedy farm are up to something nliving in concentration camp like atmosphere they are led by one plucky hen called ginger voice of julia sawalha who continually comes up with plans for escape and always gets caught subsequently spending day after day in the coal box none night brash american rooster flies in over the fence calling himself rocky mel gibson famous flying rooster and circus performer nrocky promises to teach the chickens how to fly and the situation grows more desperate as the nefarious mrs tweedy miranda richardson decides to abandon the farm egg selling plan for pie selling plan nshe orders huge pie making machine cackling chickens go in pies come out nwhat sort of pies nchicken pies of course nco director nick park and his studio aardman animation produced three oscar winning short films creature comforts the wrong trousers and close shave nthe latter two were the second and third installments of trilogy starring the delightful team wallace gromit man and his dog famous for getting themselves into increasingly peculiar adventures npart of what made the wallace films brilliantly entertaining was park uncanny ability to make an old story seem new the wrong trousers for example pulled out lot of old hitchcockian suspense tricks and close shave owed great deal of inspiration to classic detective stories nbut in the hands of park and his team the stories felt fresh and inspired and not the least bit contrived nnow teaming with co director peter lord park has created similar creature in chicken run nthe plot is largely lifted from the great escape watch for quick reference to the ball bouncing scene with some spielberg inspired action sequences providing the excitement nthing is the film doesn feel like it been lifted from somewhere else chicken run feels fresh alive like nothing else ever done npart of it is the original idea who in the world came up with the idea to make prisoners of war movie starring chickens npark and lord milk the incongruity for all it worth the characters treat their situation as if it were dead serious and to them it is nbut they re chickens so it funny to us nanother thing that helps chicken run and most of park films succeed is the animators subtle way of giving nods to the very films they re cribbing nthere are references to the great escape obviously and stalag 17 nthe chase sequence inside the chicken grinder parodies both raiders of the lost ark and indiana jones and the temple of doom nthere even nod to the blues brothers if you can believe it and the filmmakers even get in little light hearted ribbing at the expense of their star voice actor taking couple of very subtle jabs at mel gibson nationality and film history nthe braveheart reference is hoot if you catch it nwhen you consider just how fine line resides between funny parody and redundant one chicken run is downright brilliant in its execution nconsider this since july of last year ve seen dozens upon dozens of blair witch project parodies on television on the radio and online nout of all those maybe one or two were amusing the rest tiresome nwhy nbecause once you got past the thought that they re parodying that blair witch movie most of the parodies had nothing to offer no insight no original idea no greater purpose nthey were only funny if you had seen the movie otherwise you got nothing nconversely chicken run doesn lean on its parodies the film references are never the sole focus of any scene nif you ve never seen indiana jones the chase sequence is still fun neven if you have no idea who mel gibson is rocky remains an interesting character npark lord and screenwriter karey kirkpatrick realize that an audience does not need parody shoved in their faces before it understood and as result chicken run is filled with visual and verbal jabs that are never too obvious but not quite vague either nenjoyment of this movie doesn require knowledge of film history but if you ve got it chicken run is that much richer nthe voice cast turns in uniformly lively performances and the characters they play are given so many subtle nuances that it hard not to fall in love with every one of them nginger is perfect spunky and opinionated but with soft heart that forbids her to leave her companions behind and julia sawalha known as the cute mousy girl on absolutely fabulous nails it nshe has warm human chemistry with gibson whose rocky hides his personal doubt under brash gung ho veneer nthe characters inevitable romance doesn feel contrived but sweet npoor mr tweedy tony haygarth suspects the chickens are organizing in some way but his limited intellect prevents him from figuring things out and his overbearing wife certainly isn any help njane horrocks delivers lovely voice characterization as tragically optimistic babs hen that runs away with most of the best one liners all while perpetually crocheting sweater and two supply trading rats that seem to have walked straight out of monty python sketch nearly steal the show during the lively central swing dancing sequence nthey even come up with an inspired riff on something that baffled scholars and theologians alike for decades the chicken vs egg dilemma none might have expected this inevitable joke to come off as wearisome but as with most of chicken run it comes as delightful surprise nthe film manages to cross all barriers it should be accessible to both children and adults brits and yanks rats and chickens nthe animation is first rate nremember that this was all done the old fashioned way with actual humans moving clay figurines around on tiny set bit by painstaking bit and you see just how truly remarkable chicken run really is nthis movie possesses that same quality that makes pixar studios animation great precise and unwavering attention to detail nas in such top notch family fare as bug life or toy story 2 chicken run has something to offer in nearly every frame ncertainly passive viewer can enjoy it as straightforward story with worthwhile moral and some surprisingly touching scenes but active attentive viewers will enjoy it even more because they ll catch all the details nanyway the movie just boatload of fun nfunnest damn movie ve seen all year ',\n",

              " 'here is film that is so unexpected so scary and so original that it caught me off guard and threw me for loop nokay it isn quite original considering it is sequel to the box office hit species but it certainly is smart nmost films of this genre are reminiscent of those cheesy horror films from the 50s and 60s and some even become them nhowever as we learned with the 1995 small budget horror sci fi film sometimes expectations can be shattered na lot of criticism has gone against this film from what have read so far anyway yep all two reviews and it makes me wonder why these types of films are automatically dismissed as gory laughable pieces of trash nbut the thing is it isn nit well made well acted and quite intelligent ni can see most of the critics now complaining about the level of gore or the level of sexuality in the film nbut the species series isn about the lack of these elements nit about how much it can get into one film nand yet behind it all it has this basic premise that allows it to get away with doing so nspecies ii begins in the present day though it seems to be an alternate universe nmany films especially sci fi ones create similar timelines as our realistic one but change it to fit the film needs nspecies ii begins with the arrival of an american spacecraft the excursion landing on the surface of mars naboard is patrick ross justin lazard very bright and very handsome astronaut npatrick is the son of senator ross james cromwell who just wants patrick to succeed nwell it would seem that he has succeeded nlanding on the surface of mars he is the first human being to ever do so nof course he isn the first ever nabout billion years ago an alien species supposedly landed on mars and destroyed the perfect living conditions that were able to sustain life nnow of course the red planet is cold and rocky nno life lives on it nthat is no visible life npatrick upon leaving the spacecraft and landing on the red soil collects samples from the ground nhe takes them aboard and puts them in storage nunfortunately one of the samples contains form of life and it gets loose when it is heated aboard the ship njust prior to heading back to earth this life form creeps along the floor and inhabits the earthlings nthey pass out for approximately seven minutes and then shrug it off as nothing because they can even remember nthey blame it on technical malfunction nback on earth patrick begins to have strong urges to mate with as many women as possible nas we know from the original this is because the alien wants to breed and take over the planet nhowever the children that are bred are half human as their father is npatrick is really looking for another alien to breed with and he finds it in eve natasha henstridge neve was cloned from dna taken from sil the original alien nhowever this time around most of her alien urges have been either decreased dramatically or lie dormant nthe project is led by dr laura baker marg helgenberger reprising her role from species and her motives seem respectable nsince she was involved with the original alien attack she wants to learn how to stop the alien should it come again nand it has nstory wise species ii is much stronger than its predecessor but it is also much stronger than say aliens hey love the film but you can tell me it was strong on story nwhat surprised me the most with this film was the incorporation of historical facts into the screenplay nin my search for extraterrestrial intelligence course in college we learned about piece of rock from mars which landed in one of the poles nthis piece of rock contained fossils which may have been proof of life on mars later it was proven that it was not living creature that created it nthe script uses this effectively but also manages to provide well balanced plot nbeginning with the first man on mars something have always dreamed of seeing was hoping that the film would turn this element into useful starting point for the movie nand it does it quite well nthe characters are all smart and they know what to do and what not to do nthe only character that seems little cliched is the general george dzundza and yet he remains logical in everything he does nthere are the obvious flaws of course mostly lying in the technical aspects nthe special effects are only mediocre and some are just plain bad nbut for the most part they remain believable even noticed homage to the alien series when the mothers gave birth to alien children nalso the most realistic ones are usually the goriest ranging from people being torn open or someone head being blown off nhowever some plot elements also may elicit laughs from the audience including menage troi that is all but necessary nmany people dislike the species series because all it is is an excuse for sex nudity and gory violence nhowever tend to disagree nwhat were the alien films about nand if an alien species ever did come to earth and their sole purpose was to destroy us wouldn you mate as quickly as possible with as many people as possible nmy only gripe with this is during the scene where patrick goes searching for mate in grocery store ni didn realize that aliens were that picky on choosing women to mate with just assume it is his part human side looking for the most beautiful one nthe acting is quite good for this kind of film nit is vast improvement over the first film at least nthe acting is the key element to this film if it was bad it would have lowered itself into camp if it was good it would have asked for comparison with films like aliens nokay so it isn that good ngeorge dzundza is probably the most obvious mistake on casting as his over the top impersonation of general makes him annoying and distracting nnatasha henstridge is limited this time around as she is usually enclosed in cage nhowever she does manage very impressive performance with this aspect hindering any of her talent noh yeah and she quite fun to just plain watch nmarg helgenberger is immensely better this time around and her performance is probably the best in this film nmichael madsen is so so but he isn annoying and he soon becomes rather appealing with his nice cynic personality njames cromwell has small part but he makes it much better than what it could have been with more incapable actor nas say any film with james cromwell dramatically increases in likeability nmykelti williamson gives an enjoyable performance and he gives the film more down to earth feel nand of course justin lazard nlazard has so far been ridiculed for his performance but think he is effective nsure he is wooden but isn that what his character is like nthe moment when he touches the glass separating henstridge from him was extremely well done due to the couple acting nspecies ii is rated for strong sexuality sci fi violence gore and language nthis is definitely an rated film that young kids should not see nmore than likely they would probably have nightmares and never have sex for the rest of their lives nhell don even know if will nwhat is sure to be critically lambasted film turns out to be the surprise film of the year ni probably won see another film where was expecting so little and got so much for quite while ndirector peter medak has crafted very suspenseful and sometimes very scary movie out of mediocre series nmedak has also mastered the wonderful jump nmoments and has probably the second scariest moment have ever seen on film scream still has the first nstrong acting smart dialogue intelligent plotting and sure handed director species ii is exactly what these films should be entertaining ',\n",

at him has him hopelessly trying to get his family moving to set out on vacation i can talk man out of blowing up the sears tower but can talk my wife out of the bedroom or my daughter off the phone he says nwhen he gets the call to action however he quickly changes gears and becomes the man we expect him to be nsoon his character has to negotiate not only with roman but also with the swat commander david morse who is itching to send in team to take roman out all the while keeping wary of the fbi agents who are waiting to take over the operation should negotiations fail nthis complex set of pressures are reflected well in sabian the negotiator and spacey the actor nas the second protagonist spacey measures up nicely ngray really lucked out with this cast ndavid morse as commander beck ron rifkin as commander frost and john spencer as police chief al travis are all more than competent and can hold their own in scenes with jackson and spacey nthe only problem is the bit of typecasting that results from these choices morse played similar role in the rock rifkin played the a nin a confidential and spencer played police detective in cop land nwith the level of acting however this can be forgiven nalso in the supporting cast paul giamatti as rudy one of the hostages is notable for the comic relief he provides nhis character is initially so slimy and giamatti himself just looks so shifty that you expect to laugh before he even says anything nfortunately this doesn distract from the seriousness of the rest of the film but instead provides some nice breathers from the level of tension which gray manages to sustain throughout nj walsh as the suspicious internal affairs inspector clocks in with one of his final performances nsadly the talented but underrated actor passed away in late february of this year and the soon to be released pleasantville will mark his last film nwalsh appeared in dozens of movies such as good morning vietnam backdraft and nixon nfor one of his best performances check out sling blade in which he plays mental patient sharing ward with billy bob thornton nwhen jack nicholson accepted his best actor oscar in march walsh was one of the men to whom he credited his success the actors performed together in few good men nthe negotiator is actually dedicated to walsh and while inspector niebaum may not have been his best role it certainly characterizes the type of character for which walsh had become most famous for playing nin the end the negotiator has plotline that parallels it reality nwe re served with the premise that two equally deft negotiators are battling each other to resolve the conflict in the manner which will suit each of them best nas an audience we re also given situation where two wonderfully talented actors are thrown into movie and we like to see if one will dominate the film nboth provide some pretty good entertainment ',\n",

              " 'the s army utilizes number of books known as field manuals which stipulate the specific way in which almost every action imaginable must be done none particular field manual is known as the fm 22 5 which among other things covers the practice of saluting nunder the saluting section is sub section which covers how salute is rendered by military work detail in the presence of superior officer nthe salute is rendered by the highest ranking individual present when the superior officer comes within six paces of the detail and is dropped when the officer passes six paces from the detail nin any event the salute is rendered only by the man or woman in charge rather than by the whole group nalmost at the very beginning of the general daughter we see general motorcade passing work detail neveryone salutes nit looked impressive but it just wasn right nthat little bit showed me that someone either didn do the appropriate research or made the conscious decision to go with style over substance for the scene nin fact this would serve as metaphor for the rest of the picture as it seems director simon west tried so hard to craft film with atmosphere and flash that he forgot coherent story and good characterization are also crucial to good movie nwhat results is film that looks good but like that one scene just isn right nthe first fifteen minutes of the film is good example npaul brenner john travolta is an agent for the army criminal investigation division undercover at georgia army base to investigate an illegal arms sale nprior to the transaction the buyer gets whiff that brenner isn the unscrupulous supply sergeant he supposed to be and later that night attempts to kill him by shooting up the houseboat on which brenner is living nso ensues cat and mouse action sequence which ends like certain scene in raiders of the lost ark we ll just say that it involves propellers nbrenner then receives new orders when the commanding general daughter captain elisabeth campbell leslie stefanson is found naked bound and dead on one of the base training ranges nhe is teamed with rape investigator sarah sunhill madeleine stowe to uncover the truth about the peculiarly gruesome murder nwhat want to know is why the whole action scene with the arms buyer was even necessary nit gives no insight into brenner other than the fact that he a little cocky ndoes the arms subplot turn up later nno so why add this extra running time to the film nthe answer it looked cool nor how about the atmosphere nthe beginning of the general daughter presents us with imagery of the deep south thick trees dirt roads sultry colors over water all backed up with bayouesque music nnice immersion in the setting but it soon doesn matter for when the film plot shifts over to the murder investigation so does the entire mood nno attention is paid to the location of the story and the music is altered to fit very generic thriller theme ndid the filmmakers start out thinking they were making different movie ninstead of creating cohesive atmospheric theme for the entire film we get the distraction of one of theme followed by another just because the director thought he should show off some of the countryside nthe above examples also serve to illustrate that inconsistency is another problem with this movie nas ve already mentioned an entire section of the film doesn jibe with the rest and the characterization only adds to the difficulty nbrenner who comes across as man with little respect for authority suddenly snaps to in the presence of general campbell james cromwell and utters some of the corniest yes sir i ve ever heard nhe even delivers an emotion charged monologue about why he will work so hard to catch the person who killed the general daughter even though he was totally flippant about the whole thing just couple of minutes previous nsunhill who initially comes across as professional investigator utilizes couple of blatantly illegal methods to obtain information and even revels in her ingenuity nboth characters are protagonists but it hard to get behind them when their personalities are all over the place and in some cases simply unappealing ni could imagine that during filming west would shoot scene then take the actors aside and tell them let do it again but this time want more ni say this because although travolta and stowe are normally very good in this film they overact in most of their scenes nan even worse offender is clarence williams iii as the general aide colonel fowler ni swear the guy says all of his lines from the position of attention na far cry from his days as linc in the mod squad can help but think he was acting from west direction na couple of side characters including west point psychologist john beasly and young female private ariyan johnson make their scenes nearly impossible to bear nthe only two actors who seem to have escaped west influence are james woods who provides good performance as colonel moore elisabeth mentor at the psychological operations unit and timothy hutton as colonel kent of the military police nwoods relishes the role of man whose job is playing with people minds and does so without ever taking it over the top nhutton just kind of hangs around but at least he wasn overacting ni haven read the nelson demille novel on which this movie was based but ll bet more than few dollars that the story was better in book form nthe movie version has got characters which come and go with little or nothing to do except fill up space or provide bits of information which seem to neither mean anything in terms of advancing the story nor reveal any significance once the whole story is finished nevery time we re presented with some new aspect to the case west gives us more of that flash by playing it up like it the most momentous discovery ever but the information is not used by the investigators at all ninstead when conclusions are drawn they are such tremendous leaps of faith that you wonder if successful investigations are not based on facts but lucky guesses instead nthe army should have saved time by bringing in brennan and sunhill letting them play game of twenty questions with the suspects then letting them guess who the killer was nwould ve been over in half hour nthe film finishes with sort of bookend featuring the same style and southern scenery as the very beginning nliterally during the closing credits we get to see brennan get in his car and drive off then we get to see sunhill get in her car and drive off nthey both seem kind of happy nmaybe they were driving away from simon west ',\n",

zellweger who in more trouble than anyone knows back to new york has an ending that entirely predictable from the get go think charlie and irene will fall in love nyeah me too nthe farrellys then introduce scores of different characters and none of them ever manage to do anything you haven already expected them to do no matter how outrageous their actions might be ncompared to the curveballs the farrellys are used to throwing this stuff is almost entirely soft tossed presenting an obvious problem when gross out humor loses its shock value it no longer funny merely gross nthe jokes that do work are milked over and over until their effectiveness runs dry ntake for example the subplot involving charlie three black sons anthony anderson mongo brownlee jerod mixon nthe incongruity of it all is funny for while with three burly black men discussing higher math in ghetto language and white bread carrey mouthing said language with an entirely too pleasant smile on his face nbut by the end of the film they re still doing the same schitck it hasn been elevated to another funnier level and it hasn been dropped either nthat too bad because it ceases to be amusing about halfway through me myself irene reeks of wasted opportunities nthere ought to be more focus on how other people react to charlie new personality and on how charlie deals with the consequences of hank actions nthis doesn really happen nearly every supporting character learns about charlie condition early on so they don have any opportunity to be surprised by it nthe film throws what looks like patented farrelly curve in scene towards the midway point involving an albino companion charlie and irene pick up called appropriately whitey but the script doesn go anywhere with it instead leaving the thread twisting in the wind before awkwardly tying it up during the climax njim carrey is gifted comedian both physically and vocally but he left with nothing much to do here except contort himself in manner similar to steve martin in all of me nit a great showcase of flexibility and split second role shifting but none of it is terribly funny ncarrey doesn pull any stunts we don expect him to pull and the farrellys script doesn give him anything else to pull the situations in which he must perform the role shifting aren set up in any meaningful way nperhaps carrey can take solace in the fact that his supporting actors fare no better nzellweger irene is not strong female lead mary in mary may have been part adolescent fantasy but she was also intelligent and strong willed nirene is nothing in particular as the film never makes clear whether she ditzy clever or neither nas such she gives us nothing to latch onto as the only sane person in the film nchris cooper is stuck playing exactly one note as corrupt fbi agent and his character is entirely too straight laced for movie like this nhe like the others does absolutely nothing unexpected nafter viewing the shapeless mess that me myself irene eventually dissolved into was stuck wondering whether or not the farrellys had outsmarted themselves nmaybe their kind of comedy can only work for so long until audiences get wise to it and stop being shocked nbut don believe it good filmmakers find ways of surprising their audiences even after people have grown attuned to their style nif the farrellys are indeed good smart filmmakers and still think they are they ll rebound just fine neven after that happens though ll still consider me myself irene to be high caliber misfire ',\n",

              " 'like movies with albert brooks and really like movies directed and written by albert brooks nlost in america and defending your life are two of my favorite comedies nhis humor is of kind that is not very prevalent in movies today inundated as we are with films which revel in their aim toward the lowest common denominator nyou will rarely see any slapstick in an albert brooks film while the dialog will not be as oppressive as in some of the independent talk films which are finding their way into theaters nthe situations in which his characters find themselves are ones we can often identify with but even if we can brooks has the talent to make them comfortable and therefore we laugh nteenagers and jim carrey fans probably won find an albert brooks movie very funny but people who look for more than what we could find on television probably will nput simply brooks comedy is intelligent nmother is albert brooks latest film and it does not disappoint nbrooks plays john henderson middle aged science fiction writer just coming off his second divorce nhe makes an attempt at dating but fails miserably nhe then has dinner with his brother jeff rob morrow successful sports agent who seems to live the ideal life njeff has good job loving family and most of all warm relationship with their mother beatrice debbie reynolds nafter dinner john witnesses telephone conversation between jeff and beatrice and is at the same time amazed and sickened by how hunky dory the dialog is nin comparison beatrice always hints at fault in john and his career every time she talks with him and john gives it right back to her nat the end of one of their conversations where beatrice has just picked apart john life she says love you and john replies with know you think you do nthe thing is beatrice is not overt with her criticisms but instead gives them in that mothering way which is tantamount to nit picking and guilt loading nit the kind that goes something like yes dear think you do that wonderfully but nit seems as though nothing he does makes her happy nthere always the big but njohn believes that his mother is somehow connected to his failed relationships with women either because of his flawed self esteem caused by his need for validation or perhaps because he tends to unconsciously seek out women who remind him of his mother in an oedipal manner nhe comes to the conclusion that since his problems are rooted in his boyhood home he should move back in with his mother for while just to see what kinds of feelings come out and by that be able to sort out why his life is the way it is a great experiment he calls it nbrooks own brand of humor really shines in this film especially in the interaction john has with his mother nthere a scene where john has just arrived at his mother house and after having driven from los angeles to sausalito and having explained to his mother about the great experiment beatrice asks now explain to me again why you don want to stay at hotel nshe still doesn get it and it is absolutely hilarious nin the same scene we get little glances at the life his mother leads when she tries to feed him food that is no longer fresh nshe apparently buys in great quantities and refrigerates it until the lettuce is wilted and the sherbet is iced over nwhen john points out the ice on the sherbet beatrice tells him not to worry about the protective glaze you ve named the ice nasks john nhe also surprised at the variety of items beatrice keeps in the refrigerator such as twenty pound block of cheese the freezer was good invention says john but it not supposed to be used for everything nthat why it smaller than the refrigerator nit something most of us find strangely familiar nbrooks is also master at employing the non sequitur nfor example in defending your life his and meryl streep characters are in comedy club having discussion nwhen they re finished and walk out brooks cuts to the comic on stage who is just at the point of delivering his punch line and so the moral is if you have to fart go outside nyou don know what the joke was because you couldn hear him during the entire scene but must have laughed for the next five minutes it seemed so out of context nin this film brooks uses the same trick couple of times to open or close scene ni don want to give them away but suffice it to say they work just as well as they have in the past njohn purpose for staying with his mother is to learn and we as the audience learn right along with him nhis mother is not the fascinating type to begin with but as john spends more time with her we learn things about her personality and her lifestyle that give her depth nwatching the character of beatrice unfold is every bit as enjoyable as the humor that accompanies it each step of the way non screen brooks does an excellent job playing this kind of character you get the feeling he often believes he is the only sane person in an insane world nin way he very much like yosarian of catch 22 expect with something of an attitude ncasting debbie reynolds as beatrice is perfect nshe assumes the part with ease even moving and speaking little slowly and is just so adorable it hard to get mad at her character nthis only helps the audience to share the frustration john feels when dealing with her nas his first choice brooks originally wanted to lure nancy reagan out from her acting retirement to play beatrice but the former actress and first lady could not leave her husband who was beginning to show symptoms of alzheimer disease nthat may be just as well since reynolds lends softness to the character which enhances it immensely nrob morrow also does good job at playing the younger brother who has always been mother favorite and for all his success in his job and family is slowly exposed as mama boy nthe only things that hold this movie back from being better are couple of plot holes na solid connection is not really made between john troubles and his reasons for living with his mother nadditionally the end results of the experiment do not necessarily jibe with the stated goals and although this may have been sloppy screenwriting how can you be mad at the guy who also wrote this nbeatrice you must think m some kind of moron njohn no think your someone who thinks m moron nbeatrice well it takes one to know one ',\n",

              " 'after hearing reviews for woody allen upteenth movie in history celebrity range from terribly boring to just so so my heart lept when the opening images of the film closely resembled that of manhattan my personal favorite from my personal favorite director of all time nwoody allen films almost never rely on visual flair over textual flair so when one of his films closely resembles the one time that these two entities fit hand in hand manhattan really is one of the best looking films ve ever seen beautiful black and white photography of the city best areas etc fan can help but feel visibly moved nthe film opens up with the usual credits with plain white font over black backgrounds and an old ironic standard playing on the soundtrack but then the screen fills with gorgeous dull gray sky with the word help being spelled with an airplane nbeethoven 5th blasts on the soundtrack nthe city seems to stop to take notice of this moment and it all rather lovely to look at nand then we cut to film crew shooting this as the film hilariously banal key moment in the film where the lead actress in the film melanie griffith looking as buxom and beautiful as ever has to realize something wrong with her life or whatever nit a terribly stale scene for woody allen film with the great opening shots or without and my heart sank and soon got used to the fact that once again new film of his was not going to be as great as his past works though for the record last year deconstructing harry came awfully close nwhat the hell has happened to him nthe man who once could be relied on for neurotic freshness in cinema has not become less funny but his films have become less insightful and more like he tossed them together out of unfinished ideas bullets over broadway though wonderful relies on irony to pull farce that just never totally takes off mighty aphrodite is more full of great moments and lines than really great story everyone says love you was more of great idea than great film neven deconstructing harry is admittingly cheap in way even if it does top as one of his most truly hilarious films nif anything the reception of celebrity by everyone should tip allen off to the fact that this time it not the audience and critics who are wrong about how wonderful his film is it him celebrity is yes good film but it only marginally satisfying as woody allen film ninstead of creating the great woody allen world he created world out of subject he knows only bit about nand he fashioned film that is based almost entirely on his uninformed philosophy of celebrities so that it plays like series of skits with minor connections nit like la dolce vita without the accuracy the right amount of wit and the correct personal crisis nwoody becoming more insecure in his old age choses to drop the woody allen character in on the world of celebrities and then hang him and all his flaws up for scrutiny and does this by casting not himself but brit actor kenneth branagh in the lead nmuch has been said about his performance dead on but irritating makes one yearn for the real thing blah blah blah but to anyone who actually knows the woody allen character knows that branagh performance though featuring some of the same mannerisms stuttering whining lots hand gestures is hardly warts and all impersonation nbranagh brings along with him little of the woody allen charm which actually allows for his character flaws to be more apparent nwoody a flawed guy and we know it but we love him anyway because he really funny and really witty and really intelligent nbranagh allen is bit more flat out bad but with the same charm so that yes we like him but we re still not sure if he really good person or not nhis character lee simon is first seen on the set of the aforementioned movie hits on extra actress winona ryder then goes off to interview griffith who takes him to her childhood home where he makes pass at her and she denies him sorta nwe then learn through flashbacks that lee has been sucked into trying to be celebrity thanks to mid life crisis and an appearance at his high school reunion nhe has since quit his job as travel journalist and become gossip journalist of sorts covering movie sets and places where celebrities congregate so that he can meet them and maybe sell his script bank robbery movie but with deep personal crisis nas such he has divorced his wife of several years allen regular judy davis and continues on quest for sexual happiness boucing from girlfriend to girlfriend and fling to fling over the course of the film nafter griffith comes his escapades with model charlize theron who is polymorphously perverse glad to see allen is using new jokes ha ha who takes him for wild ride not different from that of the anita ekberg segment of la dolce vita nfollowing are his safe relationship with smart working woman famke janssen relationship that almost assures him success and his continued escapades with ryder whom he fancies most of all nhis story is juxtaposed with that of davis who flips out but stumbles onto happiness when she runs into handsome friendly tv exec joe mantegna who lands her job that furthers her career to national status nwhile lee is fumbling about selfishly trying to ensure his own happiness davis becomes happy ve become the kind of woman ve always hated and ni loving it nwithout doing thing nthe result is film of highs and mediums nthe mediums are what take up most of the film with sitations and scenes which don exactly work but you can help but pat allen on the back for trying nbut other places are really great scenes nthe opening nthe sequence with theron which is so good that wished it hadn ended na banana scene with bebe neuwirth droll as ever nand perhaps the best sequence romp with hot as hell teen idol brandon darrow played by none other than leo dicaprio who is so un dicaprio esque that if any of this fans could sit through this film they never look at him the same way nhe ignites the screen with intensity and spares nothing in showing his character as narcissistically tyrannical and totally heartbreaking for lee who comes to him to talk about his script that he has read and finds himself on wild all day ride with him nthey go to atlantic city to watch fight they gamble and they wind up in his hotel room where darrow gets it on with his flame gretchen mol and he lends him one of the leftover groupies nallen writing in these scenes are so good that just for them d almost recommend the film nalmost nbut what really liked about this film is despite the fact that it a mess despite the fact that what this film really needs is good old fashioned rewrite by allen himself it still smart and insightful film nthough some of the jokes are either stale or misplaced some seem too cartoonish even for this environment allen still manages to get across that this film is not exactly about celebrities as it may seem to be if it were it be extremely out of touch but about those who want to be celebrities and how they equate celebrity hood with happiness nwe never get close enough to the actual celebrities to see if they re really happy they may appear to be on the surface but we do get close enough to lee and davis character nlee is obsessed with the phenomenon while davis takes is at arm length and never gets too involved in what it is and soon becomes one herself nbesides it witty and it does have the one thing that no other film has but allen that great woody allen feel nit may be not exactly fresh and lively or totally brilliant in its depiction of its subject and yes as part of woody allen oeuvre it merely blip no annie hall but it no shadows and fog either but it goes to prove that no one can make film like him and only he and maybe godard could possibly take totally horrible metaphor like the one in the beginning and make it work not once but twice ',\n",
              " 'paul verhoeven the dutch auteur who dragged his violent sexually aggressive aesthetic into american film has never been what d consider thoughtful director though some of his films notably starship troopers have been lauded as artistic achievements but he is the kind of hollywood film maker who managed to no matter what the budget make his films distinctive and even sometimes smuggle stimulating themes into the lavish high concepts on which he toils nstarship troopers was essentially b monster movie remake of his enthralling dutch war film soldier of orange great film that nearly impossible to find on video yet showgirls is everywhere in which he cast troop of stunningly attractive mannequins the square jawed casper van dien and denise richards who may actually be 45 silicone in what feels like an american propaganda picture set to monotonous scenes of graphic carnage nit not completely successful film but as failure it certainly an interesting and mostly entertaining one nmy favorite verhoeven films were the ones he made before he hit our shores spetters dark near pornographic coming of age film set within the sub culture of drag racing and the aforementioned soldier of orange haven yet gotten around to seeing the 4th man or turkish delight ni believe his best hollywood film to be robocop bleak super hero satire with robotic hero that as touching as schwarzenegger in t2 nthat movie was violent but not in the overdone cartoonish manner of more recent verhoeven pics nits violence seemed to be there for purpose namely to create an atmosphere of unpredictable dread not to simply titillate an attention deprived audience nthere a jaw dropping scene within the first ten minutes of robocop wherein the lead villain toys with cop before snuffing him nhe tortures the officer by taking glee in his victim every fearful tic nit a startling moment of barbaric maddening violence that effectively sets the tone for the film that could be designated as splatter punk noir nin hollow man kevin bacon brutally slays dog because it just won shut up he impales co worker drowns another and so on nbut why nhis character is introduced as smug genius the kind who always impeccably dressed and races sports car while generic rock tunes blare from his stereo for the world to hear sort of like scheming uber villain from dallas or melrose place though once the character becomes invisible this film has him pull 180 shift into psychotic movie monster nthe kind who just won die nhollow man protagonists are the completely bland but beautiful scientist linda elizabeth shue acting as if she were rebecca of sunnybrook farm and her lover hunk of beef scientist played by josh brolin who saddled with the film worst lines ve lost cohesion again nthey re typical aaron spelling couple good looking but as vacant as george bush republican national convention speech e nbush referring to clinton so much promise but to what end nto what end nthis actually got applause nsuddenly warren beatty doesn look so absurd nthe rest of the film characters are all well past thirty though act like annoying high school party animals insulting one and other with series of strained one liners is it just me or have labored insults become big budget hollywood new character developing technique nahh what cynical time we live in nas the picture opens we meet cain kevin bacon an egocentric scientist working with the crew of aforementioned irritating scientists on top secret so top secret the government has only provided them with dilapidated warehouse in which to perform their extensive experimentation project with the goal to make invisibility possibility for what purpose is never hinted at nthey ve performed several experiments on animals and have nearly solved the quandary causing caine in twist worthy of the film 1950 late show origins to impulsively experiment on himself ncaine neglects to let the pentagon in on his plans and somehow gets two of his co workers to lie for him so the rest of the crew will think the pentagon gave the go ahead nour mad scientist is turned invisible after several fx heavy complications then he inexplicably it hinted that the process of invisibility has made the animals into more savage creatures but this is never explored and if that was the case why the hell would anyone be stupid enough to test this out on human nbegins raping assaulting and murdering anyone he pleases always with lame wisecrack ready la freddy krueger nit grows abundantly clear with each new release that it verhoeven films that have become hollow nlike the rest this one is cold heartless and full of contempt for humanity but in addition to all that it lacks any trace of wit insight and makes no statement other than audiences will pay for anything these days nit an affront to anyone looking for something stimulating on an intellectual level or even those hoping to spend saturday night with fun thrill minute ride nverhoeven has instead served up an utterly routine mad slasher flick with nobody to root for and no reason to care nthe previews make hollow man look like an irresistible flick nhow can one not have good time at film that utilizes state of the art fx to illustrate an invisible man getting down and dirty with his bad self na couple weeks ago after seeing the trailer bunch of friends and got into long discussion of how invisible man flicks never go so far as to have the invisible individual indulging in their newfound ability nhollow man looked like the first film to do so and whoa in serious manner to boot nbut oh yeah it is directed by paul verhoven not atom egoyan or peter greenway nverhoeven delivers the sleazy goods but not in watchable or thrillingly disturbing manner here it just feels icky and uncomfortable nthe director keeps his camera trained at his nubile actresses caressing their breasts with his lens all while faux psycho music strains in the background nit plainly obvious that verhoeven isn exploring voyeurism like in the classic peeping tom but exploiting it and not even doing that very well nit funny that with all the technology 90 million can get you verhoven is stuck at trying to figure out how to show woman naked breast manipulated by an invisible hand nmost vexing is that the invisibility aspect is used simply as gimmick in yet another slasher movie wherein characters do stupid things just so the villain can pop up for more attacks nin fact it largely irrelevant that bacon is invisible since by the end most of his potential victims don infer red glasses that track his body heat nas in every mad slasher film we get the killers pov scene where he spies on his neighbor while she undresses triggered unpleasant memories of slumber party massacre and lots of scenes where people are unknowingly stalked nthe film only provides one moment that found genuinely creepy nit happens when lab assistant kim dickens who looks like she stepped out of playboy in the middle of chit chat with an invisible bacon suddenly pauses are you looking at me she queries obviously haunted nit a little moment in big film with nothing to offer but ground breaking special effects set to plot that should have run its course by 1982 the apex of the mad slasher craze nthose special effects are so stunning they alone keep this from being as bad as urban legend or still know what you did last summer nand they re the only reason to check out hollow man preferably as mid week bargain rental nyou ve been warned nbut you probably won listen will you ntis

mediocre film look good ni happy to say that there something about mary is not one of those trailer let downs nin fact watching this film was quite fine way to spend two hours nthe film opens up in flashback to 1985 at high school in cumberland rhode island nted stroehmann ben stiller is social reject who can seem to get date to the upcoming prom until he comes to the defense of the mentally retarded warren nearl brown who being harassed by one of the school jocks nit seems warren sister is the campus queen mary jensen cameron diaz who is impressed with ted willingness to stand up for her defenseless brother despite very real chance of getting beaten up nmary takes an immediate liking to ted and asks him to the prom nted was just flattered that she even knew his name nunfortunately prom night is ruined when ted has an accident with his zipper at which every man in the theater will wince and is sent to the hospital nfast forward to the present where ted has cleaned himself up now writes for magazine but has weekly therapy sessions in order to deal with his obsession of the past 13 years mary whom he hasn seen since that fateful day nwith the help of his friend dom chris elliott ted hires slimy private investigator pat healy matt dillon to track down his only love nhowever when pat finds mary he falls for her too and soon the both of them are competing for her affections nthere something about mary is directed by bobby and peter farrelly who brought us dumb and dumber and kingpin nnot exactly intelligent comedies they are of the guilty pleasure variety where you might not want your friends or co workers to think you had such great time watching them nwith their current film the farrelly brothers have come up with something you ll not only enjoy but also won mind talking about the next day at the water cooler nthe film succeeds in employing pretty wide range of comedic styles from the subtle to the ridiculous and while few of the gags might be offensive to some seeming like residuals from the farrelly brothers last two films they almost all work ni have not seen many movies in the recent past that shoot for the mark and so often hit it dead on none minute you ll be laughing at something ted says and the next you ll be howling at the sight of dog dragging him across the floor of mary apartment none of the great things this film has going for it is ben stiller nhe is perfectly cast in the role of ted because he a guy who just looks awkward in almost every situation nted a nice fellow and tries to do his best but for some reason or another things just don always work out nit comical but also has that kind of appeal where you really feel for the him and want him to come out on top nactually ve liked stiller since he did short which aired on saturday night live back in the mid eighties nthe film was like theatrical trailer for spoof on the tom cruise paul newman film the color of money entitled the hustler of money nin it stiller played wince not vince who is taken under the wing of an older man played by john mahoney to become big time bowling hustler nit was parody at its finest more of which showed up in the short lived the ben stiller show on the fox network in late 92 early 93 nlike the critic which aired on abc then fox still mourn that show cancellation ncameron diaz is absolutely enchanting for most of the film although her character seems obsessed with perfection in the men she dates and some of the qualities she looks for make mary look paper thin at times nhowever diaz pulls the role off with such panache and charm that you can still see why she got guys just falling over each other to be with her nheck even found her laugh to be cute even though thought it was annoying during an appearance she made on the tonight show last week nmy girlfriend remarked that matt dillon doesn change and you know it really true nhe and ralph macchio must hang out or something nmaybe they live in dick clark pool house nanyway here another good piece of casting as dillon slips beautifully into the role of the guy who tries to worm his way into mary heart nthe supporting performances are also good nchris elliott has bigger part than in the abyss yes check it out next time and less annoying than in cabin boy nlin shae who plays mary neighbor magda and also appeared as the landlady in kingpin provides some good laughs especially in scenes with her benji like dog which acts as the focal point for few of the funniest moments of the film nlee evans as mary friend tucker displays flexibility in acting and accents which surprises and contributes to an interesting plot twist nthe farrelly brothers and scriptwriters ed decter and john strauss keep the comedic pacing going so that there aren any noticeable times where the film drags nthe only problem saw was their use of couple of musicians who provide segues between several key scenes nthey appear out of nowhere and actually sing plot relevant information right toward the camera nit a device which was amusing for about three seconds when they opened the film nafter that it got little annoying and it unfortunate that those spots

title sequence is so good so ominous and original that it had me engrossed before the picture even began nof course my attention dwindled shortly into the film ndisturbing behavior like so many thrillers starts off interesting and ends up laughably ridiculous nit a teen horror film with no interesting violence or sex nit a suspense film with no suspense nit an evil small town story with no story to speak of nit a disaster listless and uninspired disaster that just barely misses one stardom because of few good sequences mercifully short running time and one terrific set of opening credits nour main man is fellow named steve clark blandly played by jimmy marsden nhe moves to small town with his family after tragically his brother shoots himself nsteve is very upset about the untimely death of his brother we learn this through strange home video like nightmares that he has occasionally nthe big trial for steve is of course to fit in at school and make new friends nmarsden looks like your stereotypical jock down to the last detail so he seems poor casting choice for social reject nas social reject he falls in with some pretentious dope smoking philosophers gavin nick stahl and rachel katie holmes ngavin informs steve that the local group of jocks known as the blue ribboners are actually bunch of zombies assimilating new members into their group while sporadically killing innocent people nso it up to our group of mismatched protagonists to 1 solve the mystery and 2 do something about it nby the end of it all something has happened and things have been explained but the film still doesn make any sense ndisturbing behavior was written by scott rosenberg ni ve seen his name around recently he was one of the toucher uppers on the armageddon script and imagine that for the most part he knows what he doing when it comes to screenwriting nhe did however have complete lapse in judgement when he got the idea for this film and then decided to actually take the time to write it out nevil small town films are pretty common the last one phantoms is also dismal failure but it takes lot of skill to make the formula work nrosenberg script is complete mess lacking in even the most basic attempts at characterization nand it makes no sense nor is their any purpose when things are finally explained nthere is supposed to be an element of surprise when we see what is happening to the jocks but the film never explains exactly what is happening nthey get strapped to chairs microchip is inserted into their eyes and poof they become sex crazed superviolent machine like creatures nthe doctor responsible for all this dr caldicott bruce greenwood must be pretty nuts for thinking that this kind of behavior is step up from the way high school jocks actually behave or perhaps this is the only realistic element in the film nmuch of the writing is simply bad and rosenberg has no intuition when it comes to the way high school kids act nin one terrible scene gavin explains to steve all of the high school cliques while pointing them out in the cafeteria nup front should say that in four years of high school did not eat in the cafeteria even once nthat aside the various social groups he points out are general uninteresting and poorly shown nfor instance he points to the nerds who are all wearing glasses and playing with their laptops nit such an obvious cliche that can believe rosenberg even bothered nmost of the dialogue is forced no one says bite me nanymore and none of the scenes have any degree of wit nthis picture is not inspired and most scenes flop from one to the other with no sense of momentum or energy nthe blame for this can be placed on director david nutter who apparently likes his films dry nhorror films should at least exploit violence but this one is shockingly timid nthere are few good scenes though such as an interesting trip through an insane asylum this is however the most forced scene in the film for how our heroes get there or why they bother are things we never learn ni also liked the school janitor character played by william sadler nhe has few lines that are surprisingly thought provoking nthe acting is largely waste of talent nmarsden is as said bland thought not particularly bad nbruce greenwood is shamelessly wasted nstahl and holmes both show they have talent but the direction isn good enough to hone in on their skills stahl performance seems more like parody of high school potheads nnone of these characters expand beyond their one dimension and frankly watching cardboard cut outs of human beings run down hallways while screaming just isn all that cool ndisturbing behavior is wreck of film and it started out wreck before shooting even began ni surprised there were producers who read this script and thought that it would make good film or that it would make lot of money at the box office nit not boring or even blatantly awful but it an uninspired lump of film nit sure starts off nicely but the regression into total absurdity is so consistent that the very last scene is outright laughable nso if you go to see this film take my advice appreciate the credit sequence and pray it

some sort of sexual tension amongst some of them that built up over the years n10 the friends are all wildly successful in the world of entertainment and the arts sometimes internationally so n11 the film is filled with nostalgic radio hits from the time when they were friends sometimes causing them to get together in dance song nsince it follows these rules so closely it will probably be and has been coined off as just british big chill nand in some ways it is nboth follow the rules as said and both feature lots of bitching big confessionals and broken relationships nbut while the big chill was at least to me tad too whiny and unsatisfying peter friends hits its mark making this film funny dramatic and poignant nthe friends of peter were all in the same theatre group back in 82 performig wildly outrageous british acts for people far too stuck up to enjoy them the opening scene has them all dancing in tux tops and tutus nafter peter stephen fry wealthy father richard briers hardly on screen enough to register but oh well dies leaving giant mansion to him he has to decide whether or not to keep it nnot sure what to do with it immeadiately he decides to throw giant reunion party inviting back all his old chums nof course all or most of his chums follow the tenth rule nandrew kenneth branagh also directing here is an actor who unhappily married to tv star carol co writer rita rudner nmaggie emma thompson is successfuly publisher of self help books but looks like she needs them more than her customers as she is lonely and unhappy nroger and mary hugh laurie and imelda staunton who were also married in sense and sensibility are married and are the most successful creators of jingles in the uk but have suffered tragedy as one of their newly born twins has recently died nand sarah alphonsia emmanuel is as promiscuous as ever having new boyfriend as of two weeks named brian tony slattery who married and wants divorce because of her giving her doubts nas for peter things seem okay nthe film features lots of inner friend jokes and even some old theatre anecdotes which at least find lot of fun in as ve done lots of theatre myself nand there are big confessions brawls between the friends and by the end almost everyone is unhappy even though some have resolved their problems long before the end which kinda dug nthe final twist would seem forced an anti climactic but for some reason felt the same way the rest of the friends did nmaybe it because the people in this film are so likable that just wanted to join their clique nthat really what makes peter friends so lovable the way you just want to hang with group of friends who can be so dysfuntional sometimes but when someone in crisis can come together wonderfully for one another nit when you have giant crisis like this and people want to selflessly help you out instead of subtely pushing you away that makes you realize you have true friends and these people are true friends nnot to mention kenneth branagh is able to make the film seem nostalgic for the 80s decade grew up in unfortunately without taking us outside of the 90s nthere are some 80s classics and anti classics like tears for fears everybody wants to rule the world but unfortunately no stupid fun 80s songs think if ever did an 80s reunion film d put some crap go gos song on or at least some good old come on eileen but this is the british 80s we re talking about noh well nbut anyway the direction is pretty good although nothing amazing nbranagh forte is really making shakespeare fresh and magical but at least he very good with making less ambiguous film like this nthe writing is good from rita rudner and martin bregman with lots of good one liners and even some really bad but good puns to mock the fact that andrew lives in a peter while cutting some logs asks him is he has wood in a and andrew says no but we have hollywood punishment like that nthe actors as in most speaking movies are better than their material though with some stand out performances to the six friends as well as the outsiders like slattery rudner and phyllida law as the old housekeeper of the peter mansion na little note should be made about hugh laurie performance as he looks like he took some massive doses of prozac before doing this mean ve never seen him actually act this dramatically peter friends is really enjoyable film which makes people like me pine for some sort of future reunion although don know what kind ll have like most people don look forward to my high school reunion nbecause of the way these friends are still able to maintain the same amount of care they have for one another and after such long period of seperation just look forward to the day when can have friends like that ',\n",

comics new comic book legend was born spawn nmcfarlane spawn immediately became commercial and critical success and defining comic book series of the 1990s nmcfarlane created hero who was not only original but visually intricate allowing mcfarlane to utilize his knack for artistic detail to the max nthe early spawn issues brilliantly capture mcfarlane genius at illustration and show his early attempts at writing nwith the popularity of spawn and the success of the current warner bros batman film franchise movie version of some sort seemed inevitable for spawn nin the summer of 1997 hence new line cinema released spawn live action film based on the groundbreaking series nthis topheavy exercise in violence and special effects unfortunately topples quickly and leaves fans of the comic book like me numbed by how much spawn misses the mark nwhat happened nwhy is spawn so bad ntodd mcfarlane himself executive produced this disappointing misfire and even appears in cameo ni don think however that his presence necessarily hurt or helped the film ni place the blame in part on the recent hollywood trend fueled by public demand apparently for special effects blow out movies utilizing the latest computer technology nthese films focus upon the effects at the expense of everything else character plot dialogue etc spawn reflecting this trend shows the audience one gratuitous scene after another populated with morphing characters and filled with unnecessary pyrotechnics nhardly minute goes by in this film without fires explosions knives and chains appearing out of nowhere glowing eyes or constantly transforming demons na lot of it is visually interesting and technically solid don get me wrong but because the script and cast aren engaging spawn ultimately comes across like overwrought wallpaper the surface may capture the eye but nothing exists underneath nspawn translation of the comic book suffers the most at the storyline level nmcfarlane spawn was tortured hero na mercenary by trade al simmons was nonetheless warm man in love with the beautiful wanda nhaving died and journeyed to hell he made pact to return to earth to be with wanda nsimmons however discovers that his memories are fragmented his body creepy mess and his wife married ndespite his sometimes violent nature readers couldn help but feel sympathetic toward his plight as the spawn of

dialogue and implausible subplot general possesses the antidote to supervirus called heat 16 which he wishes to unleash to enslave the world do not help matters nspawn in an apparent attempt to duplicate the success of batman also unwisely spends too much time on villain the violator batman favored the joker over batman njohn leguizamo like jack nicholson in batman receives top billing in the cast as the violator michael jai white al simmons spawn is second ni ordinarily find leguizamo an intensely annoying presence in films which seems to make him perfect candidate for the violator nthe film however spends so much time on the violator offensive antics that they grate on the nerves napparently meant to be the comic relief in the film as nicholson was in batman especially when contrasted with the sullen spawn the violator lines are oftentimes grotesque and unfunny leaving the audience wishing he would leave nleguizamo does satisfactory job in the role but he is seen far too often in the film nmichael jai white relative newcomer to theatrical releases seems to be an appealing actor and he handles his role adequately but we see little of him without various masks on nmore time needed to be spent on white character before he became spawn for the movie to pull at the heartstrings na special note should be made about martin sheen as the over the top obnoxious evil general wynn neasily the hammiest performance in the movie it hard to imagine how sheen mucked up his role so much after all he played vietnam assasin brilliantly in the great apocalypse now nsheen excessive demeanor do not help the audience accept him as mastermind villain and comes as surprise considering his extensive career in film nmany other elements conspire with the disappointing script and abundant special effects to drag spawn down nmtv style jerky in your face editing is one of them nflames for example roll across the screen sometimes to announce shift in setting ncogliostro unlikely wannabe guide for spawn serves as poor narrator for the film nhe goofily tells the audience at one point that how much of spawn humanity is left remains to be seen as if the audience really cares as one violent sequence leads to another nthe music finally assaults the audience as much as the manic violence and offensive dialogue nloud and obnoxious hard rock fused with drum loops dominate some scenes nto be fair however marilyn manson long hard road out of hell effectively compliments spawn return to earth while filter and the crystal method can you trip like do proves surprisingly fitting theme song nfor as good comic book as it is spawn did not spawn good movie nspawn instead suffers from too much pomp and circumstance and too little plot and character development nit receives two stars for its technically well done special effects nmany other films though have equal if not superior special effects and are much better nrated pg 13 spawn seems more violent than many rated movies and probably wouldn be appropriate for the very young ',\n",

appreciate supernatural tales like the prophesy and those who crave grim dark thrillers like silence of the lambs and seven nin fact there even little twin peaks to be found here albeit with the lion share of the weirdness distilled out remember bob nthe biggest failing of fallen is that although it consistently interesting it not always as edgy and suspenseful as one might hope na serial killer elias koteas has been on the loose in philadephia but detective john hobbes denzel washington the noblest man on the police force has brought him to justice nnow during his last hours on death row awaiting his inevitable date with the gas chamber the mass murderer cryptically tells hobbes what goes around really goes around nshortly thereafter he begins to sing time is on my side as he taken on his last walk nminutes later the state of pennsylvania has carried out the execution and edgar reese is dead nbut for hobbes the nightmare is just beginning because reese wasn a normal psychopath he was the host body for mythical dark angel named azazel nand with reese death azazel is free to hop from body to body murdering and wreaking havoc at will nonly hobbes and pretty female theology teacher embeth davidtz have an inkling of what they re up against nthe rest of the cops including hobbes partner jonesy john goodman lou james gandolfini newcomer to the department and lieutenant stanton donald sutherland don have clue and as result they are in mortal danger nas depicted by hoblit primal fear and cinematographer newton thomas sigel philadelphia is dark dreary place gothic city rather than modern one nno skyscrapers or other monoliths of current architecture or technology are shown nthe most famous landmark to appear isn the liberty bell or independence hall it geno steaks nshadows and night scenes abound nthe days are cloudy and unpromising nthis is the kind of setting where it easy to believe that fallen angels walk among men nfallen plot is brimming with potential not all of which is realized nsomehow would have expected more frightening tale to emerge from something with this kind of premise nbut the level of terror like that of gore is kept in check nnevertheless there are several creepily effective scenes as the spirit of azazel moves from body to body when people bump against each other on crowded city sidewalks nthe film also boasts chase sequence of kind that can best be described as unusual nof the several dozen actors to play azazel the best is by far elias koteas exotica crash who despite only being on screen for about ten minutes gives fantastically charged performance njohn goodman also seems to be enjoying himself although his role for most of the film is relegated to that of burly sidekick nsadly however these two are the only ones who excel neveryone else including denzel washington is boring nwashington flat performance is the most disappointing surprise of the film nit not that he bad per se but he not very interesting nthere no real sense of vulnerability or desperation in the way he portrays his character and that keeps us distanced however slightly from hobbes nas circumstances become progressively more dire for the cop and as his life or death chess game with azazel approaches the point of checkmate expected to be more on the edge of my seat than was nwashington subdued approach is part of the reason for this never felt sense of urgency nhowever at least washington was believable which is more than can be said for embeth davidtz schindler list and donald sutherland nto be fair the flaws in their characters aren all acting related neither stanton nor gretta milano are well written nthat said however there nothing inspired about either davidtz or sutherland work nboth appear to be sleepwalking their way through the parts as if they know that their contribution to the film is one of advancing the plot rather than developing multi dimensional individual nnarratively fallen has few glaring weaknesses nalthough the plot proceeds with convoluted game like structure it uses denzel washington supplied voiceover to overexplain matters nat times this is actually helpful and it has use beyond the obvious but there are occasions when ponderous lines like like the night sometimes you come face to face with yourself become little hard to swallow nin addition fallen is saddled with the same kind of disgustingly bland generic theology embraced by numerous movies and tv shows like touched by an angel nhowever despite the negatives m still recommending fallen on the strength of its complex plot and especially its ending which loved nthe final scenes are startling audacious and unexpected nit not often that plot development takes me by surprise the way this one did nat time when most movies fall apart in the last ten minutes fallen manages to buck the trend and redeem itself nthis is not great motion picture but considering how bad most january releases are it a reasonably entertaining way to spend two hours nand whatever you do don walk out on the film before the end credits have begun to roll ',\n",

nthe enterprise crew in the meantime experience the rejuvenating qualities of the ba ku homeworld lt worf grows pimple data sings opera pieces picard scores with ba ku chick riker shaves while sharing bubblebath with troi and the enterprise women note their firmer breasts ncomments star trek the next generation was hugely successful sequel tv series to star trek science fiction series which developed devoted fan following in the 1970s neven though it still enjoyed high ratings star trek the next generation ended production after seven years so that the cast could replace the original star trek cast in paramount film franchise centering on the voyages of the starship enterprise nstar trek insurrection is the ninth star trek movie and the third to focus on the star trek the next generation crew nstar trek insurrection qualifies as one of those movies star trek fans such as myself would rate somewhere between okay and good nafter star trek the final frontier nearly awful movie almost as bad as the repugnant star trek voyager tv series star trek fans could probably swallow anything paramount throws out in the trek film franchise ni don wish to spend this review comparing insurrection to the eight other trek movies nmost people reading this probably haven followed star trek anyway so comparison would seem tedious at best nlet me thus make my comparisons briefly so that it out of my system star trek insurrection is not as good as the previous installment star trek first contact star trek insurrection comic tone may be best compared to star trek iv the voyage home star trek ii the wrath of khan is still the best trek movie nokay let move to the movie itself nstar trek insurrection infuses basic science fiction premise humanity exploration and colonization of space with lot of lowbrow humor and witty oneliners nthis combination works well more often than it fails but when it does fail the humor really seems cheesy nmuch of this film appeals to trek fans nostalgic fondness for the starship enterprise crew naudiences unfamiliar with trek lore may miss the significance of some plot points and may even become confused at times nstar trek insurrection begins with scenes of the tranquil life on the ba ku homeworld nforget the actors and special effects the beautiful setting of this movie with its snowy mountaintops and verdant valleys steals the show nthis tranquility however is broken by data an android who reveals to the ba ku that they are being secretly monitored by the federation and their alien allies the son nit seems that this world is veritable fountain of youth sustaining its inhabitants indefinantly in young healthy state nthe enterprise crew led by captain picard investigates data actions and uncovers conspiracy between the son and an enterprise admiral to relocate the ba ku and plunder the planet youth restoring properties nsound pretty heavy nit is though this plot anything but unique and groundbreaking is undermined by the film constant barrage of humor nwhen going after data for instance picard sings an opera piece with him this is supposed to be cute and humorous nin much more funny sequence work grows large pimple on the side of his nose as result of his exposure to the ba ku homeworld pimple which his crewmates try as they might cannot avoid looking at nthe acting in star trek insurrection is for the most part pretty good nsince they ve been playing these characters for years those portraying the enterprise crew reassume their roles effortlessly enough nthe terrific actor patrick stewart plays captain jean luc picard and delivers moral speech picard trademark with his usual aplomb nbrent spiner another fine actor plays the android data well enough again and provides the best moments of comic relief in the film though the old android wishing to be human motif will tire some trek fans familiar with the routine from the tv series nthe supporting cast who appear in this movie alone are also pretty good ndespite many other critics negative opinions murray abraham the winner of an academy award for his performance in amadeus plays the major villain ru afro well enough nru afro reminds me somewhat of the baron harkonnen in the 1984 film version of dune nlike the baron ru afro continuously has his skin looked after it is stretched and stapled by servants nin one particularly memorable scene ru afro becomes very agitated and his facial skin splits open and bleeds nru afro is no khan from star trek ii the best trek villain ever but he is much better than the forgettable dr soran from star trek generations okay promise no more comparisons ndonna murphy must also be noted as ba ku woman anij who picard falls in love with nmurphy is not young woman with supermodel body she is mature woman with an attractive countenance nthis is the type of woman whom picard for those who know the character well would be enchanted with nin fact the chemistry between murphy and stewart works very well here na particular plot point involving anij ability to slow time down an ability which she shares with picard becomes one of the most intriguing parts of the movie nfor as good as the actors and setting were star trek insurrection special effects were surprisingly disappointing nthey proved adequate sometimes barely for 1990s mainstream science fiction film but they fell way short of the standard trek movie and paled in comparison to those seen in the trailer for star wars the phantom menace trailer which reportedly preceded many showings of insurrection nthe space battles involving the enterprise and sona ships in particular seemed trite and unsuspenseful and the final confrontation between picard and ru afro took place on completely unconvincing interior of satellite nthe new enterprise itself only seen in this film and its predecessor remains largely unexplored though its exterior doesn look quite right for reason cannot explain ndespite star trek insurrection frequent comic goofiness and occasional substandard special effects enjoyed the film nit maintains roddenberry largely optimistic view of the future and rejects the gritty violence of its predecessors particularly star trek first contact though don get me wrong the dark tones of trek films like first contact can work very successfully ni recommend insurrection as matinee film for saturday afternoon especially for fans of trek or science fiction in general nrated pg can see this film being objectionable to the viewing audience young or old ',\n",

              " 'like the wonderful 1990 drama awakenings starring robin williams and robert de niro at first sight directed by irwin winkler is inspired by true story documented by physicfirst sight directed by irwin winkler is inspired by true story documented by physician oliver sacks nsince awakenings was so very good and made my top ten list the year it was released at first sight is not quite as strong since it is not directed with as sure hand as penny marshall but is still an intelligent and vibrantly acted drama nthe film begins as amy mira sorvino stressed out new york architect decides to take some time off and travel upstate to the country nat the hotel she is staying at she makes massage appointment and after long soothing session which ends with her crying as release of emotions she strikes up conversation with the handsome masseur virgil val kilmer only to find out later that he is actually blind namy doesn really care if he has handicap or not and begins to spend time with him more and more until they finally start to fall in love nonce she has returned to new york amy begins to research on virgil certain type of retinal blindness which he has had since three years of age and out of stroke of luck comes into contact with doctor bruce davison who believes he can repair virgil sight even though there have only been thirty similar cases in history nat first reluctant virgil finally travels with amy to nyc and agrees to the surgery much to the hesitance of his overbearing but loving older sister kelly mcgillis nultimately the surgery is success but problems arise since virgil cannot relate to what he sees since he has never visually seen anything before only touched objects nhe moves into amy apartment and she is eager to stand by him but virgil maladjustment begins to put strain on their relationship non the basis of the overall story at first sight is indeed film that has been done many times before and owes great deal to its predecessor awakenings nwhat will happen throughout the film can also be easily telegraphed in advance nhowever what helps at first sight rise above this predictability is in the mature and intelligent relationship that develops between virgil and amy nusually romantic pictures are of the shameless puppy dog sort the recent tom hanks meg ryan starrer you ve got mail immediately pops to mind but with this film grew to care more about the characters and their plight nthe film starts off noticably well as amy travels up north and first meets virgil nthe massaging sequences were strangely erotic maybe even more so than the later actual love scenes and as their romantic involvement quickly developed the film was both entertaining and sweet and there was clearly lot of chemistry between the two nthese joyous moments early on balanced out well with the later scenes in which their relationship is seriously tested due to contrast in the life styles that they have always known with virgil completely used to being blind and having comforting peaceful life in the country to amy eventful life in the big city nthe other major compliment that must be given to the film are the nearly flawless performances across the board nval kilmer usually cast in the macho type of role was always believable as blind person and playing his character was probably little more tricky than it appears nit was up to kilmer to not come off as someone to pity but to sympathize with and he pulled it off nmira sorvino who made spectacular debuting splash in 1995 hilarious woody allen comedy mighty aphrodite for which she won well deserved oscar as kind hearted but ditzy hooker is standout here nalthough she has made some mediocre film choices since then 1997 mimic 1998 the replacement killers she always has managed to come out unscathed and it is with at first sight that she finally has another juicy role to play nin truthful climactic scene set in amy apartment between she and virgil sorvino proves to be one of the most gifted young actresses around today and has flare for both comedic and dramatic pieces nkelly mcgillis who could have easily come off as the bad one dimensional sister instead is also given an unexpectedly multifaceted character to play as woman who may be overly protective but simply cares for her brother nfinally nathan lane who is usually little too over the top is appropriately restrained as vision therapist nthe one misstep of at first sight is in its treatment of the medical procedure done on virgil nvery little is ever said or discussed concerning it and when the surgery occurs it is so briefly glimpsed at that it is impossible to see what is being done to his eyes nperhaps the reason this aspect of the film was not more in depth was that the makers were afraid it would gross out audiences but would personally take realism even if it is graphic any day over simply giving the explanation of the surgery the cold shoulder nin awakenings the patients and illness were far more satisfyingly portrayed nbecause of how strong the screenplay written by steve levitt is in the way it deals with the main relationship and because of the fabulous performances from kilmer and sorvino the film few problems can be swept over to the side nthe adult way that the romance is depicted by director irwin winkler is no doubt in respect to the real life couple that the film was inspired by who are still together after many years even though the setting of the film was changed to new york nsince january is usually the time of year that is known as the dumping ground from bad movies at first sight comes as refreshing and sophisticated change of pace ',\n",

was hoping for little smirk during these scenes but felt sorry for the embarrassment that she put herself in ni am restraining myself from talking about the dark nature of the film the violence the scene where pit bull dangles from the bridge head submerged underwater neven the best fairy tales have bit of the macabre in it as the brothers grimm have demonstrated nno my problem is with the story or lack thereof n_babe_ is sent out to save the hoggett farm but once in the city that story is forgotten nbeing good natured pig in the midst of the cynicism of his environs is nice but other than rescue that aforementioned pit bull what did babe actually _do_ nwithout giving the ending away the farm is saved from left field quirk that had nothing to do with the pig nspeaking of pig or pig pig pig pig pig nthe word pig is so overused had they changed it to an expletive and had the pig be al pacino could have been watching _scarface_ nthis is screenwriting nfurther cannot explain the deep gnaw at my gut in the many scenes where accidents happen to good people in fantastically elaborate setups nhad it been cartoon and the victim be an equivalent of elmer fudd maybe my reaction would have been softened nbut to farmer hoggett nhis wife nan elderly mickey rooney nmuch too irreverent quick nsplice those singing mice into those scenes nthe film isn a colossal failure ni did like glenne headley schmoozy chimpanzee ni liked the pink poodle nthe dog on the cart who momentarily thinks he in dog heaven nand weird looking guy who may have been doubly cast as an airport employee and judge nbut most of the time was looking down in boredom or in embarrassment over the hacked up script nthem singing mice those chapter partitions the proficient acting of the animals none of these can

cope who is taking bath nhe is speaking directly at the screen but we immediately have feeling someone else is there nfinally he asks does it hurt to be dead napparently jake sees the ghosts of dead people but unlike the sixth sense this young child isn the focus of the picture ninstead tom witzy kevin bacon chicago lineman is our protagonist njake is his son and maggie kathryn erbe whom has just discovered she is six weeks pregnant is his hard working wife none night while at party with their closest friends tom convinces maggie new age sister lisa illena douglas to try and hypnotize him nit unexpectedly works and before long tom is seeing things he wouldn normally see including deceased teenage girl jenny morrison in his house who happens to have been missing for the last six months nseeking help from lisa she tells him that while he was under hypnosis she told him that after he awoke his mind will remain clear and free like an opened door nshe didn expect it to work but it did and the only way to stop it is for tom to somehow find way to help this girl he sees stir of echoes isn a perfect film by any stretch of the imagination but in the thick atmospheric mood it conjures up it is terrifically eerie domestic horror drama and is not only effective on technical level but is impressive in its portrayal of struggling working class family nkevin bacon and especially kathryn erbe 1997 dream with the fishes are top notch and exceedingly believable as loving married couple who nonetheless have their fair share of problems nafter tom is hypnotized and starts seeing ghastly visions he is completely taken over by his desire to solve this mystery of the disappearing girl whom he has seen lurking in his house and instead of maggie not being understanding she instead believes what tom says and aside from being little worried by what he is going through does not try to stop his pursuit nbacon and erbe are not traditional hollywood stars like tom cruise and julia roberts and therefore are easier to relate to and always plausible as struggling couple who have to work overtime at their jobs just to make ends meet nin masterfully done entrancing sequence tom is hypnotized by lisa but instead of watching him we instead see what he sees starting from his view as he closes his eyes into darkness nlisa tells him to visualize being in an empty movie theater and so we as audience members are watching movie screen from inside theater which is also showing movie screen in theater ntelling him to move closer and closer to the screen as fuzzy word in black letters pops up on the screen we begin to float closer and closer to the front of the theater until we see that the word is sleep nnever before have seen hypnotism scene as mesmerizing and brilliantly construed as this one ntruthfully this set piece and another in which tom wakes up from nightmarish dream only to quickly discover he is reliving what he has just dreamt are worth the full price of admission alone just to see them on the big screen nhaving loads of fun with her small role as maggie sister lisa illeana douglas 1995 to die for her last great character is delight but rarely used to her full advantage in feature films nfunny and enjoyably offbeat douglas gets to utter the best line in the film while talking to maggie about tom visions of the girl she remarks wouldn be worried about him seeing another girl although the fact that she dead gives one pause nalso of note are jenny morrison 1994 intersection who is truly poignant in the last half of the film when we flash back to see what really happened to her missing character and liza weil remarkable in 1998 whatever as morrison grieving teenage sister debbie nif the resolution of stir of echoes does not live up to its obviously frightful full potential and it doesn what comes before is both involving and appropriately gritty nthe music score by james newton howard and unsettling use of whispers and ghostly sound effects successfully compliment and foreshadow the off kilter frame of mind that tom is put into and director david koepp proves once again that he is director with knack for creating almost unbearably tense situations that revolve around realistically written characters stir of echoes isn as good as the sixth sense but why should it need to be nboth films are fully capable of standing on their own two feet and stir of echoes really is spinetinglingly good horror film ',\n",

affair replete with romance humor and the occasional lump in the throat nthe film opens with non verbal cue to anna stardom as the title credits appear over montage of slow motion sequences featuring the actress appearances in films and at premieres coming out of limousines walking the red carpets and such nwithout words this sequence gives us background to her character nfollowing however is set up narration by william indicating what he does and where he lives ni don know why the filmmakers chose to go with narration which tells us nothing we couldn have figured out by watching the first ten minutes of film and which never resurfaces after the movie beginning but there it is nif there were ever clear case for less is more this would be it nthe film is told nearly first person from william point of view as he is in every scene nby nature of this arrangement we get very definite sense of what he is all about and his nice guy personality wins us over easily nin fact much of notting hill strength lies in the great dialog written for this character by richard curtis na scene where william is still in shock over the fact that he even talking to silver screen goddess is made golden by the way bumbles through his attempt to offer her some honey soaked apricots from his refrigerator nor take an instance where anna kisses william and asks him never to tell anyone for fear of the incident hurting her image nwilliam assures her he wouldn say word then adds well ll probably tell myself now and then but d never believe it ngreat stuff nthe downside to spending so much time with william is that we don get to see enough of anna to make their relationship whole and plausible nwe re constantly exposed to william thoughts feelings actions and desires but don actually get the sense of how much anna really feels for him nthere are couple of instances where she declares her obvious interest but they nearly come out of nowhere due to the fact that we re not sure what she been thinking all the times in between nthis combined with the sheer iniquity of screen time between the two makes this hugh grant film hands down nhe gets the great scenes look for one in which he has to portray an interviewer from horse and hound magazine in order to speak with anna the great lines and gives an overall wonderful performance njulia roberts fans will probably be disappointed by the actress top billing and subsequent lack of involvement in the film ala sandra bullock in time to kill along with her detached performance which is only worsened by her character unpredictable behavior nanna doesn get lot of our compassion nthis romantic comedy leans little more toward the comedy than the romance much of it supplied by grant himself but with considerable help from the supporting cast nmost notable is rhys ifans as spike william eccentric roommate who is in the film for no other purpose than to make us laugh nhugh bonneville emma chambers james dreyfus and gina mckee bring up the guard as william friends and family particularly shining in scene where william brings anna to his sister birthday dinner and we get to see how these common folks react to the presence of movie star in their midst nit a scene most of us will probably think would play out in our own living rooms were we faced with similar situation nroger michell use of visuals doesn sweep us off our feet but does give us more than your typical movie of this type nfor example there are couple of instances in this film where large amounts of time pass nwhereas some films are content to simply put in caption saying eight months later michell presents us with more interesting cues such as william walk though his neighborhood while the seasons change around him nanother memorable shot occurs in park where the camera is lifted from ground level to couple of hundred feet in the air nwe re generally used to scenes where our point of view is lifted from the earth to treetop level or so but in this case the camera just keeps going up and up until we have bird eye view of the ground below nmusic is used rather glaringly as an enhancement to many of the film scenes and some of this might have been better toned down but in other areas it works to full effect nit kind of mixed bag but still fares better than many of today lighthearted movies which are so influenced by the mtv fare that the film becomes one long music video nat least this film has some pretty good music that for the most part remains relevant and appropriate nnotting hill grant and roberts will not go down in history as one of the all time greatest film pairings but the chemistry is decent and the comedic aspects of the movie more than make up for it nfor couple of hours you should expect to laugh more than cry and that not so

to escape from ordinary life chris takes up crime precisely so that they can lead normal life their little house on the suburbs is financed by his violent robberies nbut these are dreams defined by constrained by and even doomed by the limitations of the normal conventional world npam final scene takes place at the edge of the suburbs where wild bushes grow symbolically the frontier the outer

to the bahamas narriving at the start of the hurricane season julie and karla run around in very tight clothing and realize they ve walked into trap set by the rainslickered slasher with huge hook for hand ncomments may be showing some pop culture illiteracy here but have never seen an episode of the fox tv series party of five ni am only vaguely aware of the show premise and my knowledge of it comes from brief commercials half paid attention to while watching the tube party of five do know however seems to be the starting ground for actresses in the teen horror genre nneve campbell scream queen of the 90s and star of scream scream 2 and the craft is regular of the show nso too is jennifer love hewitt nlo and behold following in the footsteps of campbell hewitt now has horror franchise of her own the know what you did last summer line nthough the original film released last year was watchable enough this insipid sequel had me looking at the theater glowing red exit sign longingly throughout njennifer love hewitt is very good looking young leading lady however unlike neve campbell hewitt struggles with acting nshe just isn convincing in this film and she wasn in the original either nthis puts many young males including myself in paradoxical quandary she very attractive but the annoying spoiled valley girl type character she tries to play here is annoying to the extreme and ruins many of the scenes which emphasize exploitatively her figure nadd to the mix the equally pleasant yet irritating brandy another rising teen tv star and you get one frustrated male audience ni ve spent so much time on hewitt and brandy for reason ni still know what you did last summer though cashing in on the success of the original ultimately serves as vehicle for these two young actresses nnothing else here is original or interesting nthis movie in fact makes other recent so so horror films like urban legend and john carpenter vampires seem like stunning works of high art ni still know relies heavily on tired slasher film cliches an isolated location storm parentless teenagers false alarm nightmares lots of blue lighted darkness scenes garbed slasher who walks around in the background without the characters seeing him knives and other sharp instruments lying around everywhere etc you get the picture nthe entire audience knows all the secondary characters introduced in the film are going to receive the business end of the killer hook nthey may as well have huge targets painted on them nlike scream and its numerous knockoffs these secondary characters are supposed to serve as comic relief nunfortunately still know characters aren all that funny nin particular one character chain weed smoking guy is obnoxiously annoying and certainly doesn die soon enough nthe death scenes by the way are relatively violent for theatrically released horror film nseveral of them are uncomfortable to watch and they reminded me of the sickening gore scenes in hellraiser bloodline truly sadistic movie nthis too did not help the supposed humor still know was shooting for nand what is the deal with the slasher himself ni know that the slasher film is not particularly intelligent genre but ben willis has got to go down as one of the most silly slashers in mainstream horror ncome on the guy looks like the gorton fisherman and his gruff voice makes him sound like disney pirate nthough his lightning lit appearances ellicited much needed laughter in the theater his appearance borders on the absurd in the horror film and that really saying something nso all that left to talk about here is jennifer love hewitt and brandy nboth prance about in tightfitting revealing outfits or in various states of undress yet neither of them ever actually do nude scene nhewitt however does do post shower scene in which her thin bathrobe is quite n titillating nthis scene alone made this one star turkey earn two stars under my rating system notherwise hewitt and brandy both grate on the nerves nearly in the film for instance brandy wins the trip to the bahamas nshe and hewitt jump around and scream and screech for what seems like forever ni needed extra strength tylenol after that part noh and the film conclusion talk about repetitive npeople who saw know what you did last summer will predict still know ending at least 5 minutes before it happens nboring ni saw this movie with my brother at the local downtown movie theater nadmission is only one dollar on wednesdays and we often go see bad movies on these days just to ridicule them nit usually fun thing to do along with the rest of the audience who don seem to mind participating in mass mystery science theater 3000 type viewing ni still know what you did last summer however produced several lengthy uncomfortable silences from the audience underscoring how bad it really is nif it weren for the main actresses revealing wardrobes d have had very very hard time sitting through this lame sequel ni can imagine trying to watch it on video horror films seem 10 times better in theater because they rely heavily on audience participation and wouldn recommend it to people unless they re horror film fanatics or huge fans of hewitt and brandy ni read on website somewhere that another sequel is already in the works nwhat depressing thought nhewitt apparently needs to spend more time on tv figuring out how to act nrated this film contains lots of violence several gory scenes and couple nubile horny teenagers though the sex act itself is always thwarted ni say this is unsuitable for kids but teens wouldn have problem sitting through it especially since they obviously compose the film target audience ',\n",

their genius nthey are likely to be remembered for n nwell quite while ni like this film too nyes it a disaster slash action movie ntrue its budget is lot more money than ll ever see in my lifetime nand there not doubt in my mind that the only reason it was conceived was to make lot of money nin fact bet the producers of armageddon would have worked towards lousy film had they thought it would ve been more profitable ni certainly don care what their intentions were because michael bay the rock is such skilled director that doubt he ever make film that is difficult to sit through nof course skillful direction doesn complete the package but the rest of armageddon manages to keep everything together nthe story is well thought out and perfectly paced to provide for an abundance of action sequences that never feel out of place the acting is terrific the script is sharp and get this there are characters nyes you read that right narmageddon actually has characters you can care about nif you don like this film then you have problem with the genre itself armageddon is as good as film like this can be nif you ve seen deep impact then you know the basic framework for the story nit turns out that an asteroid the size of texas is going to strike the earth eighteen days from the start of the film nso it up to the s government to stop it why the s is always exclusively saddled with these problems is never fully investigated ntheir plan to send group of experienced oil drillers up to the asteroid drill down several hundred feet and detonate nuclear warhead within nthe head driller is harry stamper bruce willis nhis group of men is colorful bunch including j ben affleck chick will patton and rockhound steve buscemi nthere also an interesting triangle formed between j harry and grace liv tyler who is harry daughter na nand grace are of course romantically intertwined and dad isn too happy with the situation nit absurd to wish for complicated story in an event movie or special effects movie or whatever it is you like to call armageddon nit not about story it about viscera and action and thrills minute and all that stuff nit incidental really that the story is cohesive and even remotely believable because most people will be too wrapped up in the explosions to give two seconds thought to what actually happens nbut bay is the one to congratulate in this case for he has made film so entertaining and so visually sharp that doubt any director could have done it better ni think most of the budget went to cameras alone because bay films every action sequence from about thirty or forty different angles ntake the spectacular opening scene for instance in which meteor shower obliterates new york na meteor flies out of the sky and crashes into building which sends fireballs erupting into the air and cars spinning like tops upon other cars nthe action itself might take five seconds in real life but bay edits so quickly that we get the same scene in six different ways ni like his quick edit style because it abrasive and exhausting to watch nit also very loud and obnoxiously noisy at times nbut it fun to be obnoxious sometimes nthe special effects in this film put every other 1998 blockbuster to shame ndeep impact visually has absolutely nothing on armageddon and to offer comparison between the quality of this film and godzilla is simply laughable nspecial effects are very important in film like this if they re not good then the image is not convincing and the film doesn work neverything here looks bright and explosive from the little meteors bursting through skyscrapers all the way to the shots of the earth through the jutting rocks on the ominously approaching asteroid nthe effects that don look totally real are still pleasure to behold and credit everyone involved for creating the first blockbuster so nice looking that it actually qualifies as art nof course all of this would add up to little more than an above average light show if didn get the feeling that bay cares as much about his characters as he does about his action nthe film is two and half hours long and not all of that is spent submerged in numbing action nmuch of the film is dedicated to developing the various characters subplots ni won suggest that these are complex characters but their problems are real and the emotions aren put forth in sentimental and overbearing way nin fact there are three or four scenes here that had me pretty choked up and that a lot more than can say about deep impact which was banking on the feel good parts of its story nbruce willis is terrific and m glad to see him bigger than life again recent turns in films like mercury rising have been very disappointing ntyler and affleck are great together and make convincing

2001 space odyssey armageddon apollo 13 the abyss close encounters of the third kind t nthe extra terrestrial alien and aliens nwhy nbecause there is not one original idea in mission to mars nall of it is cribbed from other films and in most cases better films nif this is the sort of thing you don mind you might like the film nof course there are other reasons not to like mission to mars the main one being script written by people who seem to assume their audience is filled with people who haven used their brains in some time and who don intend to start during the film running time mission to mars manages to be both stupid and boring at the same time nthe plot cribbed greatly from 2001 concerns team sent to mars the first manned trip ever made to the red planet nluke graham don cheadle leads the team jointly formed of americans and russians nthe team encounters mysterious monolith that emits strange pulse this being nothing like the pulse emitting monolith in 2001 that one was on the moon but when they try to study it giant sand tornado comes out of the top and swallows them all except luke who survives long enough to send garbled message back to the rotating space station which looks strangely like the rotating space station in 2001 na rescue mission is planned with husband wife team woody blake tim robbins and terri fisher connie nielsen obligatory pilot with troubled past jim mcconnell gary sinise and extra crew member phil ohlmyer jerry connell along for the ride nafter some zero gravity dancing they run into problems when one of their engines is blown forcing them to attempt desperate landing aboard supply vessel nnow stranded on mars with minimal supplies the team must decide whether or not it can risk entering the monolith or if they should return home nafter all that monolith just might contain information about how life originated on earth mission to mars is one of those films that makes critic wonder where to start when talking about all the things that are wrong with it so let start with one of the things that does work director brian de palma manages to create some eerie tension in few scenes during the middle of the film nthat it neverything else fails nthe failure isn de palma fault he working from an atrocious script nonly during the sequence aboard the ship looking an awful lot like the jupiter vessel in 2001 where the rescue team air begins running out and they must frantically search for the hole and patch it up does mission to mars come to life na scene where they attempt to save comrade floating away into space also provides some tension until you realize that the entire danger more danger attempted rescue sequence has absolutely nothing to do with the rest of the film it just contrived way to generate thrilling scenes ntake it out and the plot isn affected in any way nthe sequence also suffers from few plot holes as does the rest of the film why is the ship computer which sounds strangely like hal from uh 2001 able to detect hole in the main chamber but not one in the engine nwhy did tim robbins character have to go outside the ship when the solution easily presented itself from inside nshouldn the astronauts be better trained to deal with hull breach nwhy are the characters such idiots nbecause the script makes little attempt to properly develop them nall the conflict is clumsily delivered in excruciatingly obvious exposition in the opening scene which rips off orson welles and robert altman by utilizing long opening tracking shot during which the characters repeatedly tell each other about things all of them should already know jim it too bad you can go on this mission because you were determined psychologically inadequate because your wife died right before you were to go on the mission together does anyone really talk like this ncan we find out these things in less grating matter like maybe in flashback nthe whole film is like that nthe filmmakers are not content to merely show us something and assume we know what going on they must tell us exactly what we re looking at every time nsample dialogue from the film shot of mars astronaut look there mars astronaut you sure that mars nastronaut yeah that mars all right nastronaut hey are you guys looking at mars nthat exchange isn actually in mission to mars but wouldn be surprised if it were nfor all their cribbing from kubrick spielberg james cameron and even ron howard the makers of this film haven learned to do something all those directors did very well show and don tell nde palma used to know how but seems to have forgotten nthis is mentally challenged filmmaking they assume the audience won get what going on so they explain everything five times over nfourth graders may appreciate this but more learned viewers will have their intelligence insulted nthe principal actors sleepwalk their way through mission to mars never managing to do away with an apparent m just here to get paycheck attitude ncheadle stumbles over his awkward lines narmin mueller stahl manages to thoroughly embarrass himself in an unbilled cameo nrobbins puts his game face on and phones in his standard decent guy performance nand sinise hams it up with wistful facial expressions while watching tapes of his dead wife played by kim delaney who only has one scene during which she still manages to deliver some ridiculous dialogue in heavy handed monologue about the meaning of life and especially during the stolen from no less than three movies lollipop to whoever names them conclusion which combines endless obvious explanation and sub par cgi effects with gagging sentimentality and is sure to alienate any viewers who had been enjoying the show up until then nand of course these aliens from mars who facilitated the evolution of life on earth are entirely different from the aliens in 2001 who facilitated the evolution of life on earth those aliens were from an unknown world nit could be said that fans of brainless action films might enjoy mission to mars but such comment ignores the fact that the film is also incredibly slow going nleisurely pacing might have helped film with little more substance to it but all of the substance of mission to mars has been stolen from other films and those other films dealt with their ideas in much more thoughtful fashion and generally contained more engaging characters nsupposedly we re intended to choke up when one character decides not to return home at the end of this one totally different from the one character decides not to return ending of armageddon but suspect most people will either be laughing or groaning nme alternated between the two nthere is only one good thing about the way mission to mars finally ends the fact that the movie is over ',\n",
              " 'based on the relatively unknown in comparison to spider man marvel comic book blade tells the story of half vampire half human played by wesley snipes who was born of vampire latest meal nnow swearing vengeance against all vampires blade hunts them all nhis latest challenge is his biggest though he nmust stop the vampire deacon frost played by stephen dorff from summoning the blood god and turning the rest of the world into vampires nadmitedly comic books are one of the least appreciated mediums often viewed as juvenile by most standards even seen as illiterate by some njudging by series of poorly recieved financial and critical comic book based films such as batman and robin steel barb wire the crow city of angels and the list goes on one would come to the conclusion that comic books are the worst medium to translate into film nto some degree agree with this sentiment nhaving read comic books since the age of nine m 21 right now can count the number of good comic book based movies not including japanese manga one hand 1 the crow 1994 2 batman 1989 3 superman 4 the mask and now 5 blade men in black is not on this list because it is an extreme deviation from the original comic book nwhy is this nfor the most part it is because the filmmakers understand nthe comic book medium and come up with an appropriate atmosphere to match nthe crow and batman comics call for dark gothic atmosphere which the director provided nthe mask features wacky superhero with off the wall antics which the casting and cg effects reflect nsuperman nis not over the top with colour and flash and the film reflects this nblade uses common notions of vampires and incorporates them into the film creating an appropriate atmosphere nthis is in stark contrast to joel schumacher contrived vision in batman and robin reflecting the dated atmosphere in the 1960 television show nbatman and robin proved that the director failed to realize one fundamental fact comics have grown up and so has the audience m working on scathing review of batman and robin and will post it up when m ready nwhich brings me back to blade nalthough he may be familiar character to some due to his appearances in the spider man animated show on fox one will find no single trace of the warm and fuzzy vampire hunter as depicted in the cartoon nthe film depicts vicious vampire killer that nuses every single means at his disposal to reach his ends nthe end results are not pretty by any means nthe story elements work very well for comic book story nscreenwriter david goyer who also wrote the crow incorporates interesting elements of vampire lore using science to explain many of the ideas often dismissed in vampire films nthis is presented through karen hematologist portrayed by bushe wright nthis leads to inventive use of standard medical treatments to kill vampires nadd this nto the neat little gadgets that blade uses including titanium sword complete with an anti theft device and one has an interesting premise nhowever the film works best as an action film nactor wesley snipes has nan extensive background in martial arts most of which comes from capoeira brazillian form incorporating flashy kicks choreographing every single move nproving that quick flash cutting edits are no substitute for choreographed fight sequences see batman and robin for ngood example of that wesley snipes dazzles the audience with some incredible fight scenes nregardless this film is far from perfect nthe film suffers from at least one major plot hole regarding the summoning of the blood god nthe ritual requires that number of pure blood vampires are standing on nmarked squares yet one of them is viciously murdered allowing the ritual to pass and the murdered vampire is later shown standing on the square nobvious continuity errors also surface especially during scene where deacon frost takes drag on his cigarette and is not exhaling it in the next frame there is no trace of smoke either nmuch of the special effects are not that spectacular either nwhile vampire disintegration scenes are intriguing to watch other cgi computer generated imagery effects are almost slapped together which is surprising when given the amount of time the film was given to be released the film release date was pushed back multiple times nscenes with computer generated blood look extremely fake knocking the believability factor down few notches but then m really hard to impress nthe film r rating comes from gory violence but the lack of nrealism made me wonder why it got such rating for realistic violence nwatch saving private ryan nthe overuse of cgi in films has made me yearn for the days of director george romero and makeup wizard rob bottin both pioneers in the art of gore without extensive use of cgi nstill scenes involving non cgi special effects do surface and look much more impressive such as one particularly gruesome scene where vampire tries to use blade sword without deactivating the anti theft device nwesley snipes is the saving grace behind what would have otherwise been muddled mess nwhile not talking much he is grand physical presence leaving other comic book superheroes in the dust na decent by comic book film standards storyline also helps ',\n",

unsatisfied and generally kinda weirded out nbut then again not every film supposed to leave you entertained crash is structured to play like porn flick but with significantly more plot and dialogue nwhile we see several extremely taboo scenes of weirdo sex we also have skimpy little plot going on mostly towards the beginning and maybe just hair of characterization nnot to mention the acting is generally pretty good and we don really see lot of the actors completely exposed nbut what makes it supremely different from porn is the fact that this is not an erotic experience nthis film does not posess the erotic hypnotism of henry and june or the just plain horniness of say deep throat not that ve seen it nif one was to be made completely hot by this film it would probably mean they were also into the whole auto eroticism thing nthe film leaves you cold erotically and maybe in many other ways but what it does is present group of people who live on the edge nthe film opens up on woman catherine deborah kara ungar of the game pressing her bare breast up against car in public air hangar nsuddenly man enters the frame and begins to take her from behind the film doesnt show all this though even if it is nc 17 nthe next scene has film director james james spader having sex with camera woman alice poon in an office on the highly populated set of his movie nthe next scene has the two coming together revealing to us that they re husband and wife and them sharing in one another escapades nwhile the two are arguably freaky people we at least know they love to live on the edge nsoon afterwards james is driving down the road at night reclessly of course he reading something when he drifts into the other lane and then hits another car face on njames is not killed but the passenger in the other car flies into his seat obviously dying leaving the driver helen remington holly hunter in porn also alive nthe two go through therapy together and when getting out they run into eachother again nwhen james gives her ride home they almost get into another accident and immeadiately afterwards they go to an unbusy parking lot and have little quickie as they were aroused by the accident nyou wouldn think there would be many people who shared this same kind of fetish but they run into freaky guy named vaughan elias kosteas and his crutch carrying girlfriend gabrielle rosanna arquette who are also into it nvaughan is into living on the edge as they are but he takes it to another level he loves to recreate famous car crashes nin one scene he and friend colin seagrave peter macneill recreate james dean car crash without any padding or safety belts and suffer some concussions but nevertheless get rush and the attention of the police nsoon these five are all having sex with one another be it straight gay or lesbian sex nwhile this is admittingly all bit comical the film is almost like black comedy the film does do pretty awesome portrayal of people who main fetish is living on the edge ni sure somewhere there are people who get aroused by car accidents but personally don see connection between car crashes and sex nthe main connection cronenberg shows us that both give definite rush nhis car crash scenes are quick and exciting mini masterpieces we re at first not sure if they ll take place but everytime it looks like it may occur we gasp nthen when it happens we hold our breath nthe same thing happens with sex although not in the same fashion nthese people are merely taking it to another level nthe only problem with the film is that it a tad redundant na normal porn lasts from an hour to an hour and half nthis goes on for about 100 minutes and it just seems little too long nthe sex and car crashes are far between one another and the time between them are tad on the boring side nthere no characterization although it could definitely be argued that hey it a porn and we re not here to sympathize nbut still they coulda cut it down bit nbut the film is saved with its presentation as well as some other elements nthe atmosphere is very dark and forboding creating kind of cool weird feeling nand there are several scenes are just amazing none scene has catherine and james having sex while she softly asks him questions about being with man which sounds almost erotic the way she says it na sequence involving one character death is filled with all the edgy disjointment that the film needs nand the final shot is shot perfectly creating an image of car crash and couple having sex in front of it despite the fact that she wounded nthe acting is also pretty good especially for what is almost porn ousting linda lovelace as best actress in porn nwhile james spader is pretty boring he usually pretty intense deborah kara ungar is amazing nshe speaks all her words in almost zombie like hushes and when she having sex she has blank look on her face not showing the viewer whether she enjoying it or not nin one scene she actually looks dead while someone is having sex with her nholly hunter who gets extra credit just for appearing in something like this is pretty good and so is rosanna arquette who adds kinda cool kinkiness to her role nbut the film is stolen by elias kosteas who plays his character so intensely that he almost upstages everyone nhe often speaks as he is out of breath showing definite affinity for his way of life nhe has great deal of energy in several scenes especially one scene where he taking photographs of picture and later scene where he getting freaky tatoo nhe and spader share sexual chemistry in several scenes foreshadowing later scene nkosteas is little known actor his biggest role was casey jones in teenage mutant ninja turtles but here he shows deniro like presence hinting that he capable of bigger roles nwhile hardly enjoyed crash it still pretty intriguing portrayal of group of people who if the exist are some of the strangest and most bizarre people in the world nthese people are able to share rush between two completely different entities and the film which doesn exactly pain them in negative light is sucessful in bringing them to light even if it leaves the viewer unnerved and generally freaked out ndespite the hardcore nature of the film and the subsequent nc 17 rating there also an rated version but wouldn even go near that thing anyone looking for quick turn on should just rent regular porno ',\n",
              " 'when first saw the preview for cruel intentions turned to my friend and said dangerous liaisons for kids nit was clear to me that the film would be an obvious chunk of plagiarized nonsense owing everything it is to stephen frears 1988 masterpiece nimagine my surprise to see that writer director roger kumble has given credit to his source material choderlos de laclos is recognized for his novel les liaisons dangereuses in the opening credits nand was impressed nin fact was much more impressed with this recognition than with the actual film which is an appalling excuse for movie nit kiddie porn hackwork complete with earthy sex talk and fully clothed hand jobs ni suppose this kind of movie was inevitable with all the teen high school angst movies coming out there was certainly room for pretentious and laughable movie about bunch of teenagers who think they re smarter and more beautiful than all the other people on earth combined ncruel intentions is mess in every possible way and it fails primarily in the way expected it to hated all the characters and hate everything they do ni also hate ryan phillippe so perhaps my opinion is not as objective as it could be nphillippe plays check out this name sebastian valmont nwow nisn that memorable name ni could just say it over and over again nsebastian valmont nit kind of rolls off the tongue in the spirit of phrases like sanguine vapors and velvet sandwich nsebastian valmont is the coolest guy who ever walked the earth there is no woman he can have no material object out of his reach nhe has all the money all the sex all at his fingertips nand luckily his parents never enter into his life no in the world of cruel intentions adults don really exist nthe ones who do are irritating nsebastian valmont lives with his stepsister kathryn merteuil sarah michelle gellar the bitch queen of the universe and also the woman every man wants nsince these two rich kids are so bored they only thing they can do is challenge each other with meaningless sexual liaisons nkathryn wants sebastian valmont to de virginize cecile caldwell selma blair naive dork chick who has somehow wronged kathryn nbut it too easy for sebastian valmont he wants to nail annette hargrove reese witherspoon the paradigm of chastity and beauty nso sebastian valmont and kathryn make deal which is too explicit to state here nbut dear god sebastian valmont actually begins to fall for poor annette hargrove ndangerous liaisons is great movie because the characters are all believable and because of its masterful acting ncruel intentions is bad for many reasons but it lacks both believable characters and masterful acting nkathryn merteuil is simply hateful witch girl so loathsome that would probably enjoy pouring hot lead on her nshe is supposed to be mean but glenn close gave the character some depth in dangerous liaisons ngellar while aesthetically pleasing is one dimensional and utterly repulsive nwitherspoon has truly beautiful face but her character isn the moral staple she supposed to be sure she won have sex until she in love is this really moral issue but she does some things in the last few scenes that are more than little reprehensible nbut can forget mr phillippe who continues to exceed my expectations with his impenetrable invulnerable blandness ni have to give him credit and say that he did in fact manage to change his facial expression about three times during the course of cruel intentions nand there one point in the film in which he shouts thereby defeating my hypothesis that he is vocally monotone ntrue he is bad but it doesn help that he has no character to work with nkumble has drained all the interesting aspects from this character leaving us with sex crazed lunatic who is supposed to be sympathetic because he falls in love with moral flower and shuns the wicked bitch nthe film fails in every other way too nfirst of all nobody talks like this neven the intellectuals know don bother with this kind of pointless and pretentious yammering nfor while the movie looks like it might play itself for laughs but it ends up taking itself so seriously that there no way we can join it ncruel intentions also manages to come off as soft porn in more than one scene nearlier mentioned fully clothed hand job this occurs between kathryn and sebastian valmont both of whom are intended to be hateful at this point in the movie nso if we hate them then what the point of an extended sex scene ntitillation of course nit can even work under the pretense of meaningful love scene because we hate the characters nit interesting to note some of the parallels between cruel intentions and dangerous liaisons nkumble is clearly familiar with the earlier film many of the scenes have similar tone and there are moments in frears film that kumble imitates almost completely such as the last scene in which spoiler warning the antagonist is humiliated in front of her peers nbut kids

real advantage of the most revolutionary technology available technicolor ntitanic takes revolutionary steps forward in seamlessly integrating computer graphic design with actors ngwtw places america greatest tragedy in the background of classic love story titanic does the same with the atlantic most legendary tragedy nthey both have strong willed redheaded heroines they both exploit the class differences between the aristocracy and the slaves steerage bums they were both incredibly expensive and popular nok maybe that not enough parallels nso titanic not in gwtw league nno matter ntitanic is great movie in its own right complete with spills thrills and especially chills nmuch has been made of the humongous cost of the production and all of the care than went into making the huge luxury liner come alive again nthe money was obviously well spent nthe costumes look great the sets look great the cgi graphics look great ni especially liked the expensive little touches like spending tons of money on authentic titanic china only to break it all on the floor as the ship sinks nbut writer director producer james cameron real challenge in writing directing producing titanic wasn just costuming and set design and special effects ncameron major headache was keeping the audience interested in tale where everybody knows the ending going in nhe succeeds masterfully ncameron does two things that work incredibly well nfirst he shows us modern day salvage operations on titanic that just titanic not the titanic mind you nthe first glimpse we get of titanic is the ship in its present state corroding slowly away under the hammering pressure of the north atlantic from the window of minisub piloted by treasure hunter brock lovett bill paxton ntelevision coverage of the exploration of titanic intrigues 101 year old rose calvert gloria stuart who survived the wreck in 1912 nstuart does phenomenal job in brief role narrating the story of her experience to stunned paxton and his roughneck crew nsecondly cameron keeps the storyline focused almost exclusively on the rose character and the romantic triangle between rose winslet her bastard millionaire fiancee cal hockley billy zane and the irrepressible young artist jack daswon dicaprio nthe way that big budget disaster movies usually go wrong is to have an all star cast so we see the impact of the disaster on wide group of people ncameron wisely chooses to stick with rose and jack while paying scant heed to the celebrities on board nthe supporting cast is professional but mostly anonymous other than kathy bates as the unsinkable molly brown there no moment when you stop and say oh yeah know him what he been in although would like to have seen colm meaney in white star uniform or even as the ill fated engineer nthe love story itself is rather conventional ni think some reviewers found it weak and that may be fair criticism nthe performances are the key here nzane has the meatiest part in the movie and he plays the arrogant condescending steel millionaire to the hilt nhe smooth he looks great in tuxedo and he a convincing enough jerk that the winslet dicaprio relationship looks plausible nat the moment when he sees little girl too frightened to get aboard lifeboat you can hear the wheels in his mind turning saying not can save this little girl nbut can she help me get on lifeboat ndicaprio is revelation ni hadn seen him before in anything and didn know what the heck to expect really honestly expected bad irish accent but cameron evidently decided that was bad idea so dicaprio plays poor american artist who wins ticket in poker game ndicaprio exhibits an infectious joy at being alive and being on the titanic that it hard not to like him nfrom the moment that the ship leaves port until it hits the iceberg dicaprio has to carry the movie and keep our interest and he never falters nwinslet character grows up lot during the movie and so does her performance nat first she not required to do anything but wear period clothing and look drop dead gorgeous nwe know from the narration that she monstrously unhappy with her arranged marriage to zane but there isn any expression of these feelings until she encounters dicaprio nwinslet and dicaprio develop chemistry that manages to propel the movie along until the ship hits the iceberg nit at that moment where winslet character really comes alive nfaced with real danger she drops her spoiled rich girl mannerisms and does splendid job nas rose and jack race around the doomed ship looking for shelter from the freezing water and cal fiery temper winslet turns in superb acting performance mixing courage and compassion and anger with sheer shrieking terror nof course the most interesting character is the ship itself ncameron has clearly fallen in love with titanic and shows her in every mood as deserted wreck down in the boiler room up on the bridge down in the hold at the captain table down in steerage and manages to bring the great ship back from the dead ncameron greatest gift is that he allows us to fall in love with titanic as well ',\n",
              " 'there are certain people in the world who have some talent that very few people have but they chose not to take advantage of this for some personal reason good will hunting is about one of those people nthe will hunting of the horrible title let face it this film would be bitch to title played by co writer matt damon is mathematical genius nhe can do almost any mathematical connundrum in about the time it takes to brew cup of irish cream cappuccino nand he works at mit as the janitor none day the professor of one of the most challenging courses proffessor lambeau breaking the waves stellan skarsg rd puts big problem on the board for his students to attempt to complete nthe next day it already done on the board but no one in his class claims to have done it nso lambeau puts another problem on the board this time one that took he and his colleagues over two years to prove nand duh it done again nof course they catch the guy who did it red handed will nbefore lambeau can find will again he ran away when he caught him will has gotten into fight with bunch of punks on basketball court and struck police officer so lambeau gets him out on probation with two agreements he work with him on math and he get some therapy nafter going through some therapists whom he psyches out in one way or another for hypnotist he fakes being under his spell then launches into an impromptu performance of the 70s classic afternoon delight nfinally lambeau old college roomate sean mcguire robin williams psych professor agrees to treat him and the two begin rocky relationship as sean tries to get will to open up nturns out will had rough childhood being abandoned and placed in foster homes and what not nit also turns out that will does not want to do simple mathematics all his life he wants challenge nand that is to hang out with his buds including the other co writer ben affleck and do honorable jobs like construction nis it right to make this genius follow in the footsteps of einstein and kasinsky nshould this guy be forced to do something he doesn want to do nthis appears to be one of the million questions in this film which is jam packed with greatness but does not have the totally brilliant whole it should ni not saying good will hunting is bad film at all nit a very enjoyable film with tons of great moments and lots of great things about it nthe acting is amazing with two oscar nomination worthy performances from damon and williams who have amazing chemistry together nwe also get some great support from stellan skarsg rd great name ben affleck and from minnie driver who plays will love interest skylar nthere are tons of individual moments that adored ni loved all the comedy in the film especially scene where damon proves schmuck out of college student who is quoting historian to impress some chicks his various attempts at therapy and of course my favorite scene in the entire film the one where he delivers long exstensive rant to some nsa agents about the downside of working for them ni liked the relationship between some of the people like will and skylar will and sean sean and lambeau and will and his friends nthere are scenes between them which are just amazing to watch nand there are even moments in the film which are so honest in their portrayal that felt rightfully uncomfortable nlike the break up scene between will and skylar will and sean first meeting bar scene between sean and lambeau and scene where sean tells in detail how he doesn regret meeting his first wife who would later suffer slow painful death and leave him lonely and slightly bitter nhowever the main flaw of the film is there too much of everything and not enough of it either nthe film tries for deeper relations between the characters but they re sometimes either overwritten or underwritten ntake for example the relationship between sean and will the film gets an interesting father son as well as doctor patient relationship going with out any problems but when it tries to show them as equals it falls on its face nwe hear how they went to the same town and there are even scenes where the film shows how hypocritical both of them are at times nbut this never takes off like the other parts of their relationship do nalso will relationship with his best friend chuckie affleck has nice climax but not enough rising action nwe see them joking around but when chuckie arrives at decision between the two of them it seems more like superficial reasoning than more selected one ntheir relationship never goes beyond just best friends and his decision just seems to be generalization of any two best friends instead of something more human nmaybe it was just me nand it also goes for parallelism with the relationship between sean and lambeau but that again is underwritten nand of course as in most films like this the girl boy relationship is pretty underwritten nwe never understand what they see in each other so when skylar confesses that she loves him it seems more like it there for plot details that anything else nminnie driver is interesting though and breathes life into her character nthe writing is bit at fault here but what makes all this worthwhile is the little moments in the film where it acheives true awesomeness nsure it feels overstuffed but it extremely enjoyable nthe dialogue that affleck and damon have written is amazingly fresh and seems extremely human ni think that they should get nomination for their script chiefly because of the dialogue which is amazing nwhile this is probably director gus van sant most conservative film you hardly know it the same director of to die for the only van sant film ve seen really it still pretty remarkable film albeit tad overrated what this best picture deal nand if film puts smile on my face despite posessing lot of flaws have no problem with reccomending it to anyone ',\n",

warehouse in the heart of the woods to regroup and review the tapes nthey soon discover that the tapes mysteriously skip five hours of the night nwacky hijinks ensue ntristen starts having weird dreams in which she is the blair witch everybody starts finding these weird rune like burn marks on their bodies steven and erica have some highly disturbing mutual hallucinations and everything pretty much goes to hell in handbasket nthroughout the entire ordeal jeffrey and the others continue to scrutinize the videotapes which seem to have some kind of weird images on them at about the point that the time jumps eventually tristen wanders in mutters something about reverse and from this they somehow realize that they have to play the tapes backwards nwhen they do this they discover what really happened during the five lost hours one of the things they see on the videotape is footage of themselves burying the videotapes nokay if the videotapes were being buried then how were they recording themselves oh nnevermind nthis movie was awful nsimply awful nthe characters are broadly drawn caricatures that are never allowed any depth or development nerica is the nature loving wiccan ntristen is the weak and sympathetic woman nsteven is the overbearing asshole nkim is the antisocial goth girl nold tired cliches were used to illustrate these caricatures nhow do we know tristen is weak and sympathetic nbecause she pregnant nhow do we know kim is an antisocial goth girl nbecause she wears lot of eye makeup nhow do we know the local sheriff is bad guy nbecause he has jagged teeth and talks like he straight out of deliverance nthis is weak storytelling at its worst nrather than taking the time to flesh out the characters and make them truly sympathetic the writer chose to give each one few stereotypical characteristics in an attempt to use some cinematic shorthand and thereby skip straight to the action nit didn work non top of being poorly developed most of the characters were either seriously unlikable or patently stupid honey you just had miscarriage out in the woods and got medical attention at hospital that looks like it belongs in bad slasher movie nlet get on plane home no ni am having these bizarre nightmares and seeing strange visions and want to find out what going on ok nfrankly by the end of the movie was rooting for the witch ni also felt that there was simply too much blood gore in this film nthe first movie worked by never showing us the horror nthe witch was palpable presence in that movie but we never saw it we never saw anything in fact nthe horror was all off screen and thus our imaginations worked overtime to envision what it might possibly be nthis is the hallmark of truly creepy and disturbing horror movie nblair witch 2 dispensed with such niceties and went straight for the gross out nthis was evident from the opening scenes of the mad doctors forcing white goo down jeffrey throat and continued throughout the film as the audience is treated to occasional confusing and disorienting footage of what appears to be ritual massacre of some sort nknives plunge into flesh bloody fingers trail off into the darkness and none of it is explained until the very end when it was too late for me to care nthis movie didn stop with showing us the gore either it went for broke and showed us everything nby the end of the movie there are no questions remaining about the missing five hours nit is all explained in fact it is all shown on screen in loving detail ni confess to being someone who prefers horror movies in which you never see the monster or see only brief glimpses mere suggestions of what the monster is it is not because find the monster so terrifying but because find the absence of the monster to be infinitely more terrifying ni have seen interviews with the director in which he suggested that there is no monster that all of the evil was perpetrated only by the human mind ni found this to be miserably poor explanation if it was in fact the director intent then he needs to have some words with the writer because it was not made clear at all i know lot of people who like to go to parties and get drunk and stoned out of their minds none of them has ever gone on murderous rampage and then experienced mass hallucinations with group of other people for the next week or so nand if there was no witch then what about the vanishing tree nthe snowfall of manuscript paper nhm nblair witch 2 book of shadows was horrible movie nfrom the poorly written characters to the implausible story to the plot inconsistencies to the gross out shots it was bad effort through and through ',\n",
              " 'andrew lloyd webber musicals preferably his early work with lyricist tim rice present musical which is totally unlike any musical before its time nwebber and rice do not subscribe to the gaity of such musicals as oklahoma or the slapstickness of shows like funny thing happened on the way to the forum nthey instead tackle hot issues from our past and view them differently and pack them together with redundant catchy music as well as thoughtful lyrics nlike jesus christ superstar which examined the rise and fall of jesus in his last days from fame perspective in the cool tune superstar dead judas comes back from the dead to ask jesus why he didn spread his message wider evita takes an inventive stance on its topic this time being the famed wife of argentinian dictator juan per eva who slept her way to the top and became famous chiefly because she got attention much like the woman playing her madonna although think madonna did rise to the top for her musical talent among other things evita deals with the rise and fall of eva per a woman who captured the heart of the nation after marrying juan jonathan pryce then died at the young age of 33 creating an international stir of mourning not unlike that of princess di the two do share bit in common although it wasn like di slept to the top nwebber and rice sure chose bizarre topics for their musicals but they always have point for doing it nhere they wish to expose her for what she is but still show that despite all of her many drawbacks her lying and covering up for her fascist husband but show that she was still good woman with fairly good intentions and her death was very sad nit also musical with almost no words not unsung nthe film plays like rock opera much like their jesus christ superstar with many giant musical sequences just like the old musicals even if they do possess very intelligent lyrics which create not only an intellectually enlightening experience but also very entertaining one nafter all this is musical and webber musicals never undermine this nthey are balance of energy and intellectual depth walking on fine line between the both and never stumbling on either side nthis is why the beginning of evita is kind of let down nokay it is let down ni not saying the opening moments are bad because they re pretty good nbut what comes after is lifeless un entertaining and totally unrewarding sequence where she cons singer jimmy nail into taking eva to buenos aires after one night stand nin the musical it a fun energetic sequence culiminating in the show stopper buenos aires which is also lifeless nthen punch is pulled as we see eva being screwed over by the singer instead of her leaving him where she ends up singing the sad tune another suitcase in another hall which was meant for later character screwed over by eva nthe portrayal of eva in the beginning is too soft seeming like parker and oliver stone who adapted it for the screen are afraid to present her for what she is even while it being narrated by hater of eva the omnipotent antonio banderas who presents her in negative light nfor while it looks like alan parker can pull it off nhowever the film pulls itself together in flash and after that song is over and the giddily nihilistic song goodbye and thank you where we see eva go through long line of lovers who help her ascend is magnificent darkly comical and just gleeful nfrom this point on the film is hypnotic satisfying and satirical nno more punches are thrown and the basic outline of the original musical are in tact nwe see eva woo and marry juan get him out of jail rise to stardom falter bit come back and then gradually die of cancer think it was because of cancer nmore importantly many of the themes from the musical carry on with this as well as some filling in the gaps reconnassaince work njuan who is pretty underwritten in the musical is given some extra scenes and exposed as what he was for eva an accessory na muted scene where he tries to visit her respective room but is shunned allows us to learn more about juan and understand his sadness more than we did before from the goodbye and thank you number on the film shows eva trying to cover up for the horrible government by doing cheap and petty things which wooed nation and saved government even while it left the nation people downtrodden nbut despite this the nation still loved eva and when she slipped into death the world mourned her because she was star nthat when our narrator ch comes out to show that she wasn the great woman she really was and expose her fame ndescribing this character is difficult mainly because he has no real realistic background he said to be based on the revolutionary ch guevera but the two probably could have never met like they do in the film but he serves as perspective on eva but even his perspective can help us from feeling bad when eva dies pathetic death nalan parker no stranger to bizarre musicals he done fame the committments bugsy malone and pink floyd the wall the latter which is absolutely brilliant nails the film exposing everything for what it is nwe cry for evita at the end because we feel we should by the way it is presented nhis direction is manipulative for reason to show the mourning for what it is nand there is energy throughout with lots of bright colors and scenes which are cinematically entertaning as well as enriching and deep such as the balcony scene where she sings don cry for me argentina and her death sequence which is poignant becuase of how sad it is nmadonna golden globe winning performance is much like the movie starts kinda downhill then goes up quickly remaning there for the rest of the film nat the beginning she looks like she too busy concentrating on her singing to act but she eventually gets it right though never really getting the presence of say patti lupone who did the role in its american premiere back in the late 70s nher death though is brilliant nher singing could be better though ni know she took lessons to improve her range and all but it still sounds like she trying to hard nshe sounds way too soft in several places where she should be comanding like patti nlupone heard her sing on an old evita cd and you could just feel her stage presence without even seeing her nbut it generally very good although not up to the brilliance the role really requires nantonio banderas who is almost like guilty pleasure these days m one of the few people who thinks he rocks is extremely comanding in his performance presenting lovable narrator nhis singing is very good though nothing compared to the original mandy patinkin nhe does have pretty good singing voice and great range nand jonathan pryce is pretty awesome although very brief at times in his role as juan seeming to put on poker face for his melancholy facade nalthough it gets off to rocky start rocky polite for what it really is it soon picks up and becomes wonderully poignant musical nlike the other musical released in 96 woody allen everyone says love you it a reminder that the hollywood musical may be dead but it can come back every now and then for brief performance

little ideas which would have made for couple good sequels nhowever while tim burton nicely balanced the villain batman storyline although not wonderfully joel seems to do almost nothing with batman in this one nhe gets some corny speeches couple clever lines and that it nmaybe some stunts nfor all this can even comment on george clooney as batman hardly saw the guy nand when did he had horrible dialogue to say ni think michael keaton is the quintessential batman but val kilmer was too robotic and fake as batman in the last episode ngeorge is in between them nhe not quintessential he not horrible he good nbut m sure next time when they decide to renovate the series since they ll be critically murdered for this sorry effort we ll get good script and clooney will shine if he still has the job nthe villains are the only interesting part of the series according to schumacher nlast time we had the brawn of two face as played by tommy lee jones and the brains comedy supplied by the riddler as realized by jim carrey nthis time we have somewhat sympathetic and somewhat hatable villain the same guy mr freeze nwe feel bad for his mental physical collapse but does he really need to kill everyone for plants narnold isn very good too hokey but kinda sympathetic at some points nwhen he watches old movies of his wife he actually looks somber nwow nbut uma makes the most of her seductive character getting the right point between hamminess and seductiveness nit like she almost parodying herself in pulp fiction at points nshe incredibly hot and makes the movie pretty much star

batgirl another subplot never handled past initiation period we not only see coolio but bunch of bad asses dressed as droogs from clockwork orange ni laughed at all these nthe film falls apart around the five minute mark during an enormously long action sequence which must last around 20 minutes or ndid it just feel like that nthe film should serve as another in the long line of films which demonstrate that we need more intelligent films nowadays npeople are fed up with stupid films nthat why the word of mouth killed the lost world nthat why last year indy films grossed more than ever

some of his films flatliners time to kill but lot of them suck nhe a really eccentric person and loved one of his quotes about how he admits to being mediocre director and that what makes him great

              " 'much ballyhoo has been made over this new version of lolita made in time when one would think that faithful adaptation of the infamous novel could be made over its use of pedophilia and as such it important to address it straight forwardly before any other ideals such as goodness and themes can be discussed as this film has been in film limbo for number of years lying around in vaults san distributor and having critics waiting to either hail it masterpiece or call it anticlimactic horseshit nwhen seeing this film after all the hoopla keeping in mind that there are people namely me who are fans of the novel who have been eagerly awaiting this flick since its creation well nyou just have to wonder why no one really picked it up for distribution nwhat even worse is that seeing this lolita especially the first time and if you re familiar with anything lolita is admittingly very anticlimactic nthis is real pity because when you really sit down to watch this film ignoring all the crap that has preceeded it it really quite film perhaps the best film by director adrian lyne although really look at its competition flashdance fatal attraction and indecent proposal at least besides jacob ladder ni ve seen this lolita twice the first time wasn so blown away nit seemed overly dramatic and surprisingly unaffecting nthe second time not really thinking about how ve waited for what seems like forever to see it and how m seeing it on tv set on premium cable channel and not giant movie theatre it really affected me emotionally nthe story itself is surprisingly heartbreaking one which is why it such good novel and why this is such good film nthe story of pedophile obsessed with young 14 year old girl named dolores k lolita is great because it not trash for the perverted but because it about human obsession with things that are out of one reach nits protagonist the comically named humbert humbert is not your average pedophile but seriously wounded human being who embodies how we are all destroyed by our sick obsessions and idosyncrasies nthe character of lolita is almost symbol of the forbidden apple in christian mythology something that will destroy us but that we can live without nthese ideas are all worked into this film nicely but done in way that is not heavy handed at all but instead lyrical and emotionally devastating nthe focus of this film and the reason for making it it seems was to really penetrate the emotional depths of the novel and bring them to life on the screen in beautifully dramatic images and scenes which are blatantly over stylized nthe tone of the book is comical one but it also tragic one and humbert telling the story from his perspective blows every single thing out of perspective nhumbert exists in fantsy world of his obsessions and desires and this reflects the way the entire film has been designed nwe get sense that perhaps it by doing this that humbert has really trapped himself into fate that will ultimately leave him haggard and destroyed nhe weeps uncontrollably and never lets himself get over his original 14 year old love and allows himself to embody her as lolita nhe lets his feelings for her navigate all his decisions and by the end he has nothing but overly dramatic feelings for her nthe story recognizes the extreme of this almost out of test seeing if the readers will really sympathize with someone who is socially deemed pervert and one almost wonders while reading the book if the author vladimir nabokov wrote the book as means to bring into focus his own sick obsessions and perhaps bring them to peace nthe weirdest thing about this film is that by the end when humbert has reached the finale of his obsessional journey we can easily sympathize and even identify with him nthe opening and final images of the film are the same and who hasn done similar action that is wandering about without any sense of reality or anything else but deep sadness in us nthis is the second time the novel has been adapted for the screen the first time being filmed in shock 1962 by stanley kubrick who couldn possibly have brought the novel to the screen with as much faithfulness as lyne has been able to do but did the next best thing he economized for everything and came up with droll black comedy about obsession in general nin that film he used the traps of society as benefits nthe studio demanded the final scene that of heinous murder come first in the film so to portray humbert first as murderer and second as pedophile and nwhen you see it it gives the film depth of man trapped by obsession nthe censors wouldn allow anymore than couple glances and subtle dialogue to show the um relationship between humbert and lolita so kubrick decided to play it as comedy but still allow the tragedy to seep through nlooking at these two versions especially after reading the novel and we all know that when we ve read novel and see film adaptation we are bound to be angered by any size differences it really impossible to compare them nthey both go for different things and one has lot more room to be as sexually frank as the novel was nand although it true that several scenes are similar and are thus up for comparison overall it unfair to say which one is better and which one is worse ni have never been one for saying the level of greatness of film adaptation of novel is deemed by how faithful it is and won say that here nhowever this film is pretty amazing mostly because hey loved the book and this film nearly reminded me of it nit doesn have nearly as much wit couple comical scenes and even lot of good chuckles but just not totally witty but it does have the same emotional toll that the novel had nsome of that is in the casting of the two leads njeremy irons with his deep soft british voice and gentle look is an amazing humbert nhe droll in very unique way and well no one can look distraught the way he does nhe brings wonderful sympathy to the role that goes beyond pathos and really comes up as being easy to identify with the audience nand when he looks at lolita with love and she looks at him with lust you know that he her prisoner for as long as he lives nand dominique swain who plays the title character is rather incredible nshe pulls off the tough role even better than sue lyon did in the original wonderfully balancing the qualities of seduction bratiness and self centeredness that marks the character nit easy to see why she surrenders to humbert she loves the attention and knows that she can have her way with him at any time nwhen he denies her something she blackmails him effortlessly scene involving rocking chair and little foot action is damn near classic and when he stands up to her she weeps and runs away leaving humbert to follow her nthere are two other minor characters in the film one who a road block in the beginning and the other who a reappearing threat to the relationship nthe former is charlotte lolita mother played by melanie griffith nin the book charlotte is monster of woman overbearing constantly scolding her child overly religious and ultimately selfish nand she the one obstacle humbert has to overcome to obtain his goal at least in the beginning nas played by shelly winters in the original she represented all these qualities as played by griffith here she about half of them nit annoying to watch film and play game where you try to see who could have done the role way better than the one on screen without mentioning the actor who played them first nand even though griffith is not really bad persay she nothing more nthe other is clare quilty the writer who is also trying to seduce lolita and succeeds but at price nlangella takes totally different direction than the one peter sellars took in the original nquilty was comic character in the original threat in the form of many forms popping in states of rambling german proning and eventually drunk nlangella takes the other route allowing all of the creepiness to be unearthed and the result is character who exists in shadows and low shots and who meets wonderfully ironic ending the exact opposite of what we thought of him nas you can see most of these are not improvements or mistakes done on the part of lyne and his screenwriter stephen schiff but just parts of whole new look at the novel at least cinema wise nthis version is beautiful and perpetually saddening nthe camera movements are stylized and each shot is breathtakingly rich nthe acting is for the most part wonderful and when we watch it we really get sense that for humbert who is telling the story the only two people on earth most of the time were humbert and lolita nmore importantly it takes us right up the brink of emotion then jumps right over it nby the end with humbert sadly driving recklessly in his car following what he says is the only part of his life he doesn regret we feel that we all lose to something we can never have ',\n",

almost as if making an ironic self depreciating remark the movie tosses in clearly marxist imagery nno no njust kidding nhad you going there for moment didn i nin all seriousness however and to be fair to the movie it is necessary to provide two viewpoints that of movie watcher unfamiliar or only marginally familiar with the whole mortal kombat phenomenon and that of fan of the first movie and or fan of the games nthe first movie mortal kombat 1995 concerned itself with martial arts tournament that would decide the fate of earth and it 5 billion inhabitants nthe mortals won and in theory this should have prevented the emperor shao khan from taking over the earth nunfortunately shao khan was poor loser and the very final scene in mortal kombat showed him arriving anyway ready to take over the planet as our heroes assumed fighting stance nthe first movie was extraordinarily entertaining for those like myself who are fans of the game ni even go so far as to say that many folks who didn know about the game probably enjoyed the movie nthe writers and directors knew the limitations of both their cast and of the basic story itself and they didn try to overachieve nthere were lot of really cool fight scenes with really cool accompanying music intersperesed with some distracting but ultimately non intrusive bits of fluff passing itself off as plot nand as we know the movie was smashing success at the box office nmortal kombat annihilation picks up precisely where that movie left off with some introductory exposition to clue in those who may not have seen the first movie nshao khan has decided that he going to take over the earth anyways and to hell with some silly rule about mortals winning the tournament nthereafter follows approximately 85 minutes of film that alternates between being confused being trite being silly and being just plain stupid none gets the general impression that the producers of the movie thought hey that last movie was such success that we can get more money and make real movie now ntoo bad they didn simply stick with the formula from the first movie ni could write volumes about the things that are wrong with this picture but here are the high points the acting is truly bad nsandra hess playing the sonya blade character is particularly execrable especially in scenes where she tries to convince us that she loved johnny cage character from the first movie who gets greased at the beginning of this movie in one of the worst pieces of mis casting think ve ever seen james remar plays raiden the god of thunder nin the first movie christopher lambert played raiden and played his character as though he was in on the joke french actor playing japanese thunder god being revered by chinese mystics ni generally like it when actors are cast against type tim tiny lister jr being cast as the president of the s in the fifth element for example and remar has always been one of my favorite utility actors but he so totally wrong for this part that he doesn even have the luxury of amused self awareness there are too many characters that are introduced as being potentially important but then never seen again there are number of completely meaningless story sidetracks including muddled scene where liu kang robin shou seeks out nightwolf litefoot has mystical hallucination and then wanders off with jade irina pantaeva nfor these reasons and many others can only give the movie 2 unless you re huge fan of the games and or the first movie nin that case the following critiques also apply sandra hess while being an even worse actress than bridgette wilson who played sonya blade in the first movie is much more convincing as fighter nwilson looked like she was simply mimicing some movements taught to her by the fight choreographer nhess looks like she actually knows some martial arts and puts together much more believable fight scene in the fights each of the characters does at least one thing they do in the game and often more nsonya does her kiss of death jax does his earthquake liu kang does his animality and so on na big bonus for those of us who were looking for similar moves in the first movie and found them only rarely there aren as many fight scenes in this movie as there were in the first because the folks making the movie mistakenly try to hang more robust plot in between nsilly silly folks nand the lamest fight involved two of the women in what turns into mud wrestling match nlame and so obviously sexist even politically incorrect for the most part noticed and remarked upon it the special effects are generally better except for the final fight scene between the emporer and liu kang in which both perform their animalities nmotaro and sheeva are both more convincing and lifelike than goro was in the first movie nfor folks like myself who loved the first movie and enjoy the games give this 5 nyou ll probably like it but not nearly as much as you liked the first one

feebly amoral scientist nforest whitaker and alfred molina are also served poorly by the script nthe species story is relatively simple we have been radioing information about ourselves and our dna out into space since 1971 and have been receiving answers for two years note that in the 1970 we really didn know diddly about the human genome structure and were hardly in position to radio out set of blueprints for human beings neven today all we can do is give information about dna and how it works not copy of human dna because we don have it analyzed yet nthe answers we get from the unknown alien source are plans for recreating member of the alien race and doctor xavier finch played by ben kingsley is placed in charge of the attempt nthe script begins to go off the deep end at this point when the result is beautiful young girl who can shape shift into any of several ugly alien life forms nthe first half of the film has something to offer as sil the alien girl struggles with her multi form existence changing from beauty to lizard to giant cockroach and back again all while trying to understand her own place in the cosmos nshe seems oddly knowledgeable about human society with glaring gaps where her social skills should be nher instincts are to mate and procreate and some of the best scenes deal with her attempts in this area nescaping from her birth laboratory in utah sil is pursued by team of drafted civilians with orders to find her and kill her nshe goes on an eating binge spins herself cocoon and emerges as an adult played by natasha henstridge who goes long way toward re creating the sheerly inhuman beauty julie christie achieved in 1960 nthe pursuers michael madsen is an assassin exterminator forrest whitaker is convenient empath psychic just as though the s government actually had such people on call nneither is able to do much with the writing and directing provided nwhitaker role seems to be aimed at making whitaker male copy of star trek the next generation counselor cleavage nthe other members of the strike team are played by marg helgenberger and alfred molina nkingsley and whitaker are both consummate professionals too good to not work to the best of their abilities but the performances donaldson elicited from the rest of the cast are disappointing and bland and it is apparent that the direction was bit weak nh giger design for the main form of the alien creature is actually bit boring when we finally get to see it although previous digital effects were done quite smoothly nthe main fault of species is lack of originality it starts out with wonderful albeit borrowed premise and then doesn live up to it nall we get are chase scenes and few nice sex scenes with few monsters tossed in nthere is no buildup of tension and suspense no climax worthy of the name species is just sequence of scare scenes stuck together nthe movie is carried by its chase and sex scenes but not rescued by them non the other hand as an exercise in sci fi action adventure it certainly beats the ichor out of judge dredd nspecies earns an extra rating point or two for having ben kingsley and natasha henstridge on board but by and large it fun only for those of us who really like this sort of thing nmy personal rating is three stars but knock one or two of those off if you don enjoy pretty unclothed ladies and bloodthirsty alien monsters nmpaa classification violence gore nudity sex language nstars ben kingsley michael madsen forest whitaker alfred molina marg helgenberger natasha henstridge directed by roger donaldson

              " 'with the success of the surprise hit alien directed by ridley scott sequel was inevitable nin fact after watching the first film sequel was wanted particularly by this reviewer nhanding over the director chair to recent box office gem james cameron who had only made two films previous to this one pirahna ii surprisingly dull film and terminator making cameron household name the alien series got face lift of immense proportions ninstead of being suspense science fiction film cameron alters the series and changing it into an action picture nwhat results is one of the most terrifying films ever created na film like aliens comes along only once in while and when it does audiences are usually unprepared for it ni never saw this movie in theaters but wish could have nthe terror and fright must have been unimaginable most likely with audiences members literally shrieking in fear naliens is an action film unlike any have ever seen nwith science fiction plot cameron gives aliens added testosterone pumping up the action and fire power from the original film nin fact aliens is one of those few sequels which tops the original nperhaps what makes the alien series so impressive is the hero or heroine as the case may be nnever have we had more sympathetic hero in an action film and never have seen such an impressive acting job done by the main character nsigourney weaver is possibly the only actress who could play this character and make her realistic enough for us to care about nplacing woman in these situations would sometimes seem unusual but because of weaver presence woman is the only suitable hero naliens begins 57 years after alien ended nlieutenant ellen ripley weaver is discovered in hypersleep on the nostromo and is awakened nshe explains how she is the only survivor of her past encounter with the aliens but the company is doubtful nthey explain that colony of families is flourishing on the same planet from which she just left ndespite stern warnings from ripley the company remains rigid and won call the families back nhowever when the company loses contact with the colony ripley story seems much more feasible none of the company directors carter burke paul reiser wants to gather team to travel to the planet nthis team includes buff private vasquez jenette goldstein questionable corporal hicks michael biehn and loyal android bishop lance henriksen nburke tags along with ripley as they fly to the planet in order to locate the members of the colony narriving on the planet the team finds most of the human life extinguished in cocoon type environment nthe only survivor is 12 year old rebecca newt jorden carrie henn nripley finds this chance to be the mother she never had the opportunity to become and she becomes newt surrogate mother nripley and newt are the only ones who knows what has happened and soon all hell breaks loose naliens not only multiplies the thrills and suspense from scott version it also multiplies the number of aliens in general nalien focused on one alien in particular which systematically killed each crew member except ripley who managed to jettison the alien out of the nostromo naliens focuses on an entire race of these aliens and as result the chills are incredibly heightened nthen again this is james cameron the guy who has given us true lies and terminator 2 judgment day nhe is the best action director out there topping renny harlin who directed cliffhanger and only he could create something as terrifying as this film nit seems that every alien film seems to have some memorable scene or scenes and aliens has the motherload nwith perhaps one of the most astonishing endings ever created for an action film aliens climax never seems to hit until the viewer is nearly pushed to extreme exhaustion ni can recall another film ever to sustain this level of intensity throughout never dropping for moment njust when you think the movie is over something else will occur and it starts right back up again nwith seemingly endless conclusion aliens ends with one of the greatest moments in film history nthis scene is usually the one remembered most from the film as lieutenant ripley steps into one of the lifting machines to fight the alien queen nusing flawless special effects the climax is exhausting leaving any audience member drained from extreme anxiety nof course for film of this genre to work properly the technical aspects must be realistic enough for us to believe what we see naliens is completely realistic even decade after its initial release nthe special effects are wonderfully seamless with terrifying alien to go with them none of the most overlooked aspects of this film is the music composed by cameron regular james horner nhorner has created terrific score receiving an oscar nomination for his work nnot only that horner has also created one of the best scores for any action film or science fiction film ever and that includes 2001 space odyssey which was mainly compilation of well known composers nin fact the climax music is also some of the most recognized of film music nthe production design is incredible which also happened to snag nomination from the academy ndark corridors lit by red lights are very impressive but more impressive is the amount of terror which arises from well lit locations nnormally film will be very dark in order to scare viewer aliens uses lights to scare the viewer nthen of course is the cinematography which uses point of view shots along with video feeds in order to build suspense nsome of the scariest scenes involve the perspective of ripley nsurprisingly the acting is not only above average for this genre but some of the best nsigourney weaver received an oscar nomination for her portrayal of ripley incorporating the right amount of sympathy into her hard edged persona nweaver soars above the rest in this film but she is supposed to ncarrie henn gives an above average performance for child developing three dimensional character from her quiet attitude nlance henriksen is terrific as bishop showing that androids don always have to be flat characters njenette goldstein shows fair amount of enthusiasm with her role and steals several scenes of her own though her personality becomes slightly annoying when she isn fighting nmichael biehn gives very nice performance in the most obligatory role of the film nhowever biehn does good job making it seem original again npaul reiser may seem like an odd choice to play the sleazy corporate director but reiser manages to pull it off quite well however still see him as paul on tv mad about you na very good cast which also includes bill paxton and william hope highlights this action film making it stand out from others naliens is rightfully rated for violence gore language and terror naliens is sort of the redefining moment of the science fiction genre as alien was more of suspense horror film naliens pumps up the stakes and cameron directs it with professional quality ncameron certainly knows how to make good action film but here he proves how he can create some truly horrific moments on screen ntechnically astonishing aliens only flaw is small characters who are only there to get killed naside from this you probably won experience anything like aliens for quite while ',\n",

              " 'one of the biggest cliches of any serial killer film is also one of the most believable nyou know the one where the detective looks at wall of pictures and other police information and suddenly spots the clue which reveals who the killer is nsure it been used over and over but for some reason it is always fun to watch nthis cliche pretty much describes the level kiss the girls works on overused but always fun none of my personal rules about watching film is not how original the film is but how it goes around giving its story nthis rule applies highly to kiss the girls nthere is something psychologically stimulating in well crafted serial killer movie and kiss the girls is certainly well made nhowever the whole film screams of unoriginality and so it relies on the power of its actors and the technical detail to pull it through nwell not only are the actors capable of pulling it through but they add so much to the film that nearly every flaw is covered up nunfortunately one of the most revealing and rather insulting choices by the filmmakers one that seven film lot like this one knew not to make was to put the name of the killer in the opening credits nthat may give the actor credit for the role but throughout the film hidden in my mind was waiting for him to appear on screen which spoiled the mystery nhowever credit must be given to the director for suspending this knowledge through most of the film nplotwise kiss the girls shows almost no originality nwe are introduced to detective alex cross morgan freeman forensic psychologist and immediately we are given the cliched scene establishing him as the hero nhe gets call about woman who has shot her husband and is now threatening to kill herself nobviously cross succeeds at getting the gun but this scene is quickly forgotten during the next scene nat his house cross is told that his neice naomi gina ravera has been missing for four days nthis provides the motivation for cross to find the killer but we are never given chance to establish the relationship between the two and as result we can sympathize with detective cross nhowever what makes kiss the girls slightly original is the introduction of one of the abductees nbefore she is abducted ndr kate mctiernan ashley judd the actress of the judd family is smart athletic woman and because of these traits becomes target for casanova what the serial killer likes to call himself nbecause of these character developing scenes we care for mctiernan making the abduction scene all that more suspenseful nafter being abducted mctiernan wakes up and finds herself in cell somewhere in the woods nremembering that the killer gave her certain rules she decides to break one of them by calling out nwhen casanova comes to punish her she breaks out and escapes by jumping over waterfall nafter she is found she begins to help cross find his neice nfrom this moment on kiss the girls takes on the form of every other serial killer film as the two leads search for the rest of the victims held captive nmany people will compare this film to 1995 seven another killer film starring morgan freeman but presume that the similarities are intentional nthe screenplay by david klass is adapted from the novel written by james patterson and yet don quite see how this story could have worked in novel form nwhat makes kiss the girls so good is the acting and the technical and visual impressiveness nthe cinematography by aaron schneider is reminiscient of seven and sometimes felt that many of the shots were trying too hard to impress us nsometimes simple shot is the best one nhowever many of the shots are stunning and unlike seven most of them take place during the day in sunlight nthe scene when ashley judd is running through the forest is extremely well done in more than one way nthe camera work is terrific but the editing makes this scene work so well nthe chaotic and mtv type cutting gives the audience sense of confusion and unawareness exactly what judd character is experiencing nhowever the best aspect of kiss the girls is its actors nmorgan freeman is one of today most powerful and believable actors ndetective cross is very good character for him although it is just similar one to the character in seven nbecause of freeman powerful presence he carries half the film by himself nthe other half is carried by ashley judd one of today most promising dramatic actresses nin fact her performance is better than freeman if that is even possible nher character is more original than freeman and she handles it wonderfully nwe finally have female character in movie like this who does more than just scream nthe supporting cast is highly underdeveloped but the cast members do as much as they can with it ncary elwes portrays cop in north carolina and unfortunately has scraps for character ntony goldwyn fairs slightly better but we don really get to know his character either ngina ravera gives good performance but again she isn in many of the scenes nso as result of all these small supporting parts the weight of the film lies on the two leads and they do phenomenal job nsome of the best acting of this genre and some of the best acting of the year ntwo other essential aspects of the film are quite good ndirector gary fleder does good job of controlling his actors but the second half of the film loses believability especially during the revelation of the killer nhe also doesn handle the suspenseful scenes as better director would have losing lot of tension during many scenes nhowever to his credit he does manage terrific first half npart of the blame falls on david klass ni sure the book developed many of the lesser characters more but klass focuses on the two main parts nwhile this may give the two leads more screentime many of the small characters are one dimensional and the killer when revealed is extremely implausible nthanks to the smart dialogue adapted from the novel kiss the girls always seems intelligent nnone of the conversations are laughable and all move the plot forward without seeming forced none of the biggest problems had with the movie was the motive of the killer ni blame this mainly on the casting director because the killer motive is because of rejection from women or so assume from the opening monologue but the killer himself is very attractive one of my friends is shall we say big admirer of the killer nkiss the girls is rated for terror violence language and suggested sex nwith all the implausibilities of this film and with the mediocre second half kiss the girls somehow manages to thoroughly entertain nin fact had the urge to see it again just for the performances nthe cinematography adds lot of mood to the already creepy tone and the script is usually smart nthis is clearly one of those movies which rely on the acting to pull it through nmorgan freeman is possibly today most convincing actor and ashley judd adds another notch on her acting belt ni must also say that loved the ending nthe showdown between good and evil was quite tense and the resolution of the scene makes almost anyone cheer nperhaps it may not be possible but most of the film isn anyway ',\n",

              " 'it has been three long years since quentin tarantino stunned the cinema world by claiming the cannes film festival palme or 100 million plus box office gross and an oscar nomination all for his sophomore outing pulp fiction nsince then the talented film maker has been virtually invisible surfacing briefly as co director of the wildly uneven four rooms and the screenwriter of the gory vampire fest from dusk till dawn nin between he has moonlighted as an actor with several decidedly unmemorable performances nnow with much fanfare and anticipation tarantino has returned with his third directorial effort jackie brown nand while this motion picture adapted from elmore leonard novel rum punch offers solid entertainment those expecting another bravura outing from tarantino will leave theaters disappointed nfor the most part jackie brown is pretty ordinary crime movie nthe story which starts out slowly develops into twisty affair with double crosses and triple crosses nand the movie is littered with occasional tarantino trademarks witty dialogue unexpected gunfire 70s pop tunes and close ups of womens bare feet nyet for all of that the production is something of letdown nthe sheer in your face exuberance that marked reservoir dogs and especially pulp fiction is absent nthe mostly straightforward chronology of jackie brown doesn match up favorably to the non linear style of tarantino previous efforts an approach that added tension and edginess to the narratives nand there aren nearly as many deliciously offbeat conversations this time around nthere a samuel jackson monologue about guns jackson chris tucker argument regarding the merits of hiding in car trunk and jackson robert de niro exchange that recalls some of the jackson travolta material from pulp fiction but that about it njackie brown lone innovation is its presentation of crucial sequence from three different perspectives nthis isn exactly an original technique it has been done numerous times before most famously in akira kurosawa rashomon and most recently in edward zwick courage under fire nhowever while in those two movies and others there was legitimate plot reason for the multiple points of view tarantino sole purpose for using it appears to be because it unconventional nhad the scenes in question been shown from only one of the three vantages nothing would have been lost nas result this aspect of the film is little more than curiosity nfor the second picture in row tarantino is attempting to revive the career of 70s icon nthis time around instead of john travolta it blaxploitation queen pam grier foxy brown has become jackie brown nin one of many nods to the most famous segment of grier career tarantino uses 70s song to accompany her first appearance during the opening credits nthere are also several instances during jackie brown when the director offers sly wink towards certain conventions of the blaxploitation genre although grier never does any butt kicking ngrier is jackie brown flight attendant who gets caught transporting drugs and money into the united states nshe working for gun dealer ordell robbie samuel jackson but she keeps her mouth shut under questioning despite pressure from ray nicolet michael keaton federal official nno longer sure whether or not he can trust jackie ordell arranges for bail bondsman max cherry robert forster tv banyon to post the necessary 10 000 then plans to shoot jackie if she proves disloyal njackie passes ordell test however and soon the two of them are plotting way to smuggle 500 000 of ordell money into the united states without tipping off the feds nsoon just about everyone is after that money including jackie max ray ordell perpetually oversexed and drugged out girlfriend melanie bridget fonda and his right hand man louis robert de niro nunsurprisingly the most memorable performance is turned in by samuel jackson but ordell isn nearly as invigorating or compelling character as jules from pulp fiction nin addition to looking fantastic pam grier is also quite good although hers is not an oscar caliber performance although she might get nomination nrobert forster and michael keaton are solid in their tough guys who rarely smile roles nbridget fonda is around for three discernible reasons to look sexy in bikini to provide little twisted comedy and to satisfy tarantino foot fetish nrobert de niro is criminally underused in part that could have been played equally well by any grungy looking middle aged actor nthe film which clocks in at several minutes over the two and half hour mark is probably too long for the material but the plot is convoluted enough to keep us guessing throughout although the payoff is letdown ntarantino keeps things moving along nicely with heavier dose of humor and less violence than in pulp fiction but on the whole this movie seems more like the work of one of his wannabes than something from the director himself nwhen it comes to recent caper films like the grifters and bound jackie brown is second tier effort nit an entertaining diversion but not masterpiece and certainly not an oscar contender ',\n",

significantly less than ideal ni watched the matrix in theater that is in serious need of upgrades at the best of times nunder no circumstances should it have ever been allowed to show big budget special effects laden film like the matrix nthis theater owned by the parent company of one of hollywood biggest studios hasn even graduated into stereo sound yet nthe mono sound that the audience was subjected to sounded as if it was coming out of speaker that was many years past mandatory retirement age nin other words the sound sucked nas someone used to digital sound in movie theater bad sound doesn do anything to add to film ni not even going to go into the horrible splicing job that the projectionist did putting this film together nthere ve had my rant now on with the regularly scheduled review nwhich sadly won include commentary on the film sound which m assuming was spectacular but m just guessing nmy guess on the sound seems like fairly solid one considering the visual quality of the matrix nit is nothing short of stunning visually nsadly the rest of the film while pretty good doesn quite measure up to the obvious effort that was expended on making this film look so darn good nthe matrix has at it core good concept although it strays into the confusing side more often than would have liked nkeanu reeves plays computer hacker who is drawn into the frightening realization that reality is just hoax nit turns out that that many years ago the world was devastated by some sort of disaster nnow machines run the planet and humans spend their lives in sort of incubator plugged into computer network nthe computers are generating virtual reality world which is representation of the earth before it was destroyed nthe population of the planet never realizes that their entire life is hoax and that they really spend their entire lives as comatose nthat is except small band who have discovered this horrible secret and have escaped their virtual prisons nthey now spend their lives combating the computers in an effort to expose this lie nreeve character neo is recruited by this band of rebels led by morpheus laurence fishburne nnewcomer carrie anne moss and one of hollywood most underrated actors joe pantoliano join fishburne in the band of freedom fighters nthe action sequences are nothing short of spectacular nthis can be attributed as much to the amazing special effects as to many of the actor extensive pre production training in martial arts nthis lends itself to some of the best martial arts sequences that you are ever likely to see in film nwhen you add this to some of the wild effects in the computer generated world it all adds up to an eyeful nas already said the visuals far outpace the rest of the film nacting in the matrix is not bad but it certainly isn real good either nkeanu reeves gives his usual fairly emotionless performances nalthough to his credit it is one of his better performances nlaurence fishburne on the other hand often seemed to forget that he was in sci fi action film nmore than few times he delivered his lines as if he thought he was performing in some sort of shakespearean drama njoe pantoliano was little under used in this film but he made the most with what he had ncarrie anne moss turned out surprisingly good performance for this her first feature film role nit nice to see that she was cast as much for her talent as for her breathtaking looks nyou have to give all of the main actors healthy dose of credit for the work that they obviously put into the physical training for their roles in this film nit was clear that no small effort went into getting the moves down perfectly for the fighting sequences ni also put much of the blame for the somewhat strained performances in the matrix on the dialogue which was terrible at times nin more than few places it got way too existential for my liking and at other times it was just plain weird nit almost seems as though the writers were having difficult time trying to figure out how to explain the concept for the movie nso they decided to make the dialogue as obtuse as possible so that no one could figure out what the heck they were talking about nthereby covering up any leaps of faith that they may have had to make in the departments of logic and believability nmy other major complaint with the matrix was with the very unsatisfying ending nthe setup for it was hokey and frankly used in many bad film before nthe ending itself was just plain strange nthe main reasons to recommend the matrix are the visual effects and computer animation which make this real treat to watch nwhile the rest of the film acting dialogue and to degree plot detract from the high production values they don detract enough to prevent me from recommending the matrix as fun way to spend an evening ',\n",

picture unstable rounders is exactly the kind of movie parents don want their kids to see nit not that it a drunken orgy of sex and violence but because it a film that flat out says you can make career out of gambling nand to take make things worse it proves this through its original fascinating story nthere have been countless crime films both past and present that evoke the noir mood that is the dark shady atmosphere where the vices of the world become more fascinating on screen than they would in real life nthis film starts off in the tradiational noir style introducing us to the underworld of modern gambling where the stakes are high and so is the price for losing nmatt damon stars as mike mcdermott 20 something law student in present day new york city who tells us how the game of poker is really played ndamon narrates throughout the film but the entire opening scene is voiced over so perfectly to completely and totally define the setting nmike about to go up against teddy kgb malkovich russian gangster who looks like serial killer nbut then again he practically is one and the film does everything to convey that sense the look in his eyes his slow movements his intricate mannerisms all combined with the classic noir cinematography of isolated brightness within the darkness of the underworld literally ndamon in the flesh might seem little out of place with his expensive clothes and perfectly groomed features but his narration is what brings it all together nhe never sounds like he reading from script nor that he trying to embellish anything it just comes natural to him nthe screenwriters use the right words and phrases to describe the mood from the smell of the air to the logic involved in reading the other guys faces and cards and all without sounding remotely trite nimmediately we get the sense that poker isn for gamblers but for near geniuses with nerves of steel nthe game is quiet war with strategies just as complex and the same sense of honor among the soldiers nthe gangsters mike plays against are the same ones that might kill someone for scratching their car but when it comes to the game of poker all respect is due to the winner because he is truly the better man nthe film does an excellent job in establishing its atmosphere during the first act nit concentrates so much in this aspect that the background and the progression of the story stumble bit nwe learn only little about mike both past and present npresently we know he has girlfriend named jo gretchen mol who he constantly argues with over his gambling nthey go through few break up make up cycles until mike childhood pal and fellow rounder worm norton is released from prison nit not at all surprising worm owes thousand of dollars to the mob but what is surprising is how the film is able to take such predictable element and execute it the way it does ntechnically the plot isn unlike many children sitcoms in which the good kid bad friend gets the good kid in trouble and yet the good kid remains friends with the bad kid nwhat this film does is use different medium to tell that story nmike and worm have been in over their heads their entire lives but both share passion for out thinking the other player who is trying to do the same to them nwhere as worm prefers to go the sleazy route of cheating hence his jail time mike always takes the cards he dealt and works with them nsometimes they pay off e nhis ability to pay his way through law school on his gambling money but other times they don i nthe fact he takes himself out of the game and works steady job after dropping 30 000 on single hand nonce things start happening the film is able to expand and develop its plot into an intricate web of detail and mood nmike and worm bob and weave through all kinds of games at all kinds of places from socialites mansions to taking the tourists at atlantic city to outwitting the gangsters that control it all neverything they come into contact with is big poker game in that everything a battle against the cards destiny deals none scene demonstrates this perfectly in which mike is told by judge martin landou in perfectly cast and performed role that destiny is everything and yet nothing at the same time nmatt good at gambling but he also got potential to be great lawyer nhe could go professional as either but with one he could lose everything or win big but with the other there stability but not much risk involved ncan someone who gambled his entire life really cash in his chips and leave nif the film had been just subtle lesson in poker playing then the ending is our test neverything is told from mike perspective but we re finally able to recognize some things on our own nthis makes the final against all odds showdown seem like just that nit works just like the game it revolves around showing us some of the cards but still evokes the element of the unknown and the consequences thereof nwhat separates rounders from most other films about games is the fact the challenge and the skills are more important than winning in the end ',\n",

put their differences behind them and work together to hate others such as the jews nif harmon was merely trying to point out how idiotic society can be then apologize for being so harsh on elements of his film but it is presented so mean spiritedly that can help but feel like he had some serious intent nas for the entire central theme of the movie m afraid that it one that just don get ni tried to keep an open mind while watching it but the homosexual elements were just too prevalent for my tastes nit was hard enough to watch them bash other races and sexes without them preaching about the virtues of being homosexual and accepted by society nhow does one expect to be accepted if they are just as guilty of non acceptance ni not prone to judging anyone and believe that people should be free to explore whatever avenues they wish free from the scornful eye of society but don force your particular rhetoric down my throat if you aren going to show the same respect for my preferences that you wish from me nagain maybe m missing the satirical point that harmon is trying to make but if so think it could have been handled little more tactfully nas far as musical comedies go isle of lesbos is no trey parker and matt stone musical but good portion of the songs are maddeningly catchy ndespite the disturbing visuals mom and apple pie stuck with me for the rest of the day nspeaking of disturbing visuals wedding bells ain ringing could have been decent song but the accompanying visuals of spousal abuse are more harrowing than this film should be displaying i a lesbian which is touted in the press release as being particularly popular is also pretty good but good portion of that could be due to the stellar singing voice of ms smith nit mainly on her excellent vocals that my rating of this film is based nthe other performers are decent save for the rosie donnell like performance given by danica sheridan ni have no inherent problem with her character it is just her singing voice that leaves little to be desired none particular musical number lesbian rock was one of the lowest points have ever experienced in my film going life thanks to strained and lackluster vocal job by sheridan nthe film ends about twenty minutes before the credits actually roll nthe remainder of the running time is padded out with few more songs lesbian rock included and the ridiculously presented anti nukes message tacked on to the end for no reason other than to make it feature length film nonce the isle of lesbos reprise was reached felt the story had already been wrapped up well enough to end it all nwhy was the film needlessly stretched out past its obvious end nisle of lesbos is available on videocassette from www indie underground com nthe transfer is pretty clean and all the detail of the wrinkled cloth and paint backdrops are readily apparent and the film is letterboxed at approximately 1 85 1 nin many respects isle of lesbos has incredible cult potential like rocky

four years ago nthe play has garnered international acclaim with productions in chicago los angeles london vienna norway and the soviet union nuhry himself wrote the screenplay for the film adaptation of driving miss daisy he also penned the wonderful sleeper mystic pizza nthe film like the play is set in atlanta georgia and it revolves around two people in their twilight years cranky 70 something jewish widow who feels guilty about her wealth and 60 something black man who becomes her chauffeur nthe movie relies on character rather than plot to propel the action nin fact the movie has no discernible plot in the traditional sense it doesn present linear story in which all the scenes flow together nrather driving miss daisy is made up of the routine activities of everyday life shopping listening to the radio visiting the cemetery eating fried chicken and so on nthe film also incorporates into the story line actual events in atlanta history including the 1958 bombing of the temple the city oldest jewish congregation and 1965 ceremony honoring the reverend dr martin luther king jr nthe story begins in 1948 with daisy tandy crashing and wrecking her packard as she pulls out of her driveway nthe insurance company cancels her insurance and her son boolie decides to hire her chauffeur nfreeman reprising his role from the play plays the chauffeur hoke nthe film chronicles the

than anything it about relationship one that spans 25 years 4 cars the advent of civil rights and one gravely important 33 cent can of salmon ndaisy is strong willed and set in her ways and from the outset she is utterly opposed to the idea of having chauffeur ninitially she treats hoke with contempt refusing to let him drive her anywhere nonce she does get in the car daisy is the ultimate back seat driver nto make matters worse she is extremely self conscious about what others might think if they were to see her being escorted around town by hired hand neventually however daisy is worn down by hoke good natured charm and infectious cheer she softens and opens up to him ntandy plays the part of daisy exceedingly well but unfortunately this feisty cantankerous character is just smidgen too commonplace nwe ve seen this woman countless times before in other incarnations from on golden pond to cocoon nnevertheless tandy manages to put enough of personal stamp on the familiar character to make it her own nfreeman as hoke on the other hand gives the more distinctive of the two performances nthere is something profoundly moving about the way hoke maintains his pride and dignity in

gorgeous shots of flowers trees and tomatoes nin adapting driving miss daisy from the stage to the screen the filmmakers have achieved delicate subtlety nuhry understands that what his characters do

agree or disagree notions when making collective decisions nthey are given official skull paddles nwhen flipped to one side they indicate the member agrees with the proposal nfacing the opposite way means disagreement nwouldn they merely express themselves verbally nhell no nthey have to retrieve the paddles for proper vote and maybe afterward they can play ping pong ni still chuckling about

hand cannot court such excuses to explain zardoz or his follow up film the equally awful exorcist ii the heretic nboorman obviously had sizable budget matinee idol movie star sean connery in the lead role and although you wouldn know it from this film boorman does indeed have talent nthis is the man who made the slick modern masterpiece deliverance 1972 as well as the autobiographical world war ii drama hope and glory 1987 the slightly over conceived arthurian epic excalibur 1981 and the father son jungle adventure the emerald forest 1985 nhis films all show that boorman is never lacking in imagination but sometimes that comes at the cost of coherence and taste nif boorman is anything he ambitious and when he succeeds it in grand fashion nunfortunately the bigger they are the harder they fall and when boorman falls the resounding impact can be heard for miles around zardoz is meant to takes its place among the grandest of mystical movies an obsession of boorman nhis screenplay tries to elicit the same mythological connotations of the arthurian legends or even the wizard of oz book which figures into the movie plot nbut despite all this reaching the resulting movie is more unintentionally funny than intentionally enigmatical or compelling nthe events take place in the distant year 2293 but there is little of the typical futuristic movie ness to be found nin fact things seems to have moved backwards with people riding horses shooting old style guns and living in large victorian mansions nit more middle ages than space age nthe world of zardoz is divided into two distinct hemispheres the outlands where all the poor pathetic people live and the vortex where select group of wealthy intellectuals live in comfort and everlasting life nthese immortals never grow old they never engage in sexual activity they possess psychological powers and they live in sort of quasi utopian marxist society where everyone is equal and everyone contributes equally to the society nhowever if one breaks the rules that person is punished by being aged so many years nif someone breaks the rules enough he or she is aged to the point of senility and imprisoned to an eternal existence in geriatric home with others aged criminals none of the immortals arthur frayn niall buggy squirmy man with mustache and goatee tattooed on his face is charged with keeping order in the outlands and forcing the residents to farm so the immortals can be fed nlike the wizard of oz he adopts god like status among the people by flying in to their part of the world in giant stone carved like menacing head this flying head is one of the movie opening images and it a dead giveaway of the lunacy to come ncalling himself zardoz frayn gathers bunch of outlanders and makes them into group called the exterminators whose purpose is to kill most of the other outlanders so they can procreate and take up more resources nfrom inside his giant stone head zardoz bellows seriously laugh inducting statements like the gun is good nthe penis is evil nthat line alone is worth the movie cult following none day an exterminator named zed sean connery sneaks into zardoz flying stone pushes frayn out and goes back to the vortex nonce there the immortals label him brutal and study him like lab rat taking great perverse care in exploring his sexuality which is mystery to them nthey seem especially interested in his ability to gain an erection and there is one downright hilarious sequence where bunch of scantily clad female scientists show zed erotic footage on video screen in an attempt to determine what gets him worked up ni say hilarious because that is exactly what zardoz is nit is obvious that boorman did not intend it to be so he made this film with the straightest of faces although have hard time believing that as production moved forward he didn get even the slightest inkling of how patently ridiculous it was becoming njust looking at connery is enough to give one the giggles he spends most of the film running around in red loin cloth that resembles diaper mane of hair braided halfway down his back wyatt earp style handlebar mustache and pair of thigh high patent leather boots that would look more appropriate on cheap hollywood hooker nboorman made the film right after the critical and financial success of deliverance which is the only reason can imagine studio would green light this effort nhe attracted some rich talent on both sides of the camera including cinematographer geoffrey unsworth 2001 whose striking visuals are about the only good thing in zardoz besides the inadvertent humor nsean connery had made his last james bond film in 1971 and perhaps he was looking for change in pace nhe got exactly that in zardoz and it a wonder it didn end his career ni sure boorman intended for this movie to make some grand statements nis it treatise about the infallibility of eternal life nis it condemnation of those who consider growing old to be bad thing nor is it social statement something about the inherent negativity of class distinctions and the violence it creates nkarl marx might like it if he were more like timothy leary ncome

no revelation in un coeur en hiver in the traditional however the film is incredibly successful in its passionate dramatization of passion denying protagonist stephane daniel auteuil nstephane daniel auteuil is master violin maker nhe is passionless about all that which surrounds him except his craft and the music which his craft is responsible for producing neven the relationship between he and his boss maxime andre dussollier is controlled and almost manipulated association highlighted by the fact that stephane permits maxime to win close squash matches nin the beginning of the movie stephane is closed solitary individual and the audience is carefully left to wonder about the depth of emotion behind this enigmatic man ncamille kessler emmanuelle beart is master violinist and the new love of maximes nmaxime is so much in love with camille that he plans to and does leave his wife nlike stephane camille is outwardly very controlled and reserved sacrificing all thought and emotion to her violin and the music which emerges nwhen stephane and camille meet there is recognition of bonding by both individuals nhowever whereas camille submits to the wild interplay of emotions which she now feels for stephane stephane only admits that camille is attracted to him nstephane ignores his feelings for camille which the audience cannot help but to see is present nas the movie progresses the two characters become more and more polarized in their views and emotions for one another nthese two people with very similar approaches to life initially react to their new circumstance very differently nstephane becomes even more rational and controlled while camille becomes more tempestuous until she almost borders on suffering nervous breakdown due to the inability to consummate their relationship nhowever their approach to each other is perhaps not surprising considering their vocation nthe audience is led to believe that stephane may have been genius as violinist as well due to his relationship with master violin teacher nhowever apparently he could not be violinist due to his intolerance for flaws in his playing nconsequently stephane becomes precision craftsmen with the instrument and no longer plays nin contrast camille had almost given the violin years earlier nhowever with the aid of her manager she has progressed to being almost one of the world finest successfully submerging herself to her playing nduring the course of the movie we see both characters evolve as they struggle to meet the challenge of their new emotions nstephane attempts to remain unchanged nhowever we do see subtle hints of his transformation none of the most obvious is when he defeats maxime in squash nthe development of all of the characters many of which is not included in this synopsis is incredible namerican movies with rare exceptions have not and would daresay cannot approach foreign films in character development nin its essence this movie is about the development and growth of the characters camille and stephane nthe portrayal of all the other characters in the movie including death is to further the development of camille and stepahne characters ni am not sure why berardinelli says at times it becomes difficult to determine whether stephane should be pitied or vilified and it is to auteuil credit that he manages to maintain this uncertainty nthis movie is not about judging stephane actions as being right or wrong but about viewing their growth and accepting the characters as who they are ni find the ending appropriate unfortunately found the last ten minutes which led up to the final scene to be very unfulfilling nthis portion of the film is where the sense of closure could have been successfully accomplished nunfortunately there is hurried and almost soap opera type surge of emotions from all of the characters nwhile ravel may not be quite as accomplished as schubert or mozart ravel has his day in this film nthe synergism of the tension of ravel music and tension on the screen is the best have ever seen nthe directing in this movie is wonderful nthe actors and actresses are excellent each playing their part with great sincerity and warmth nemmanuelle beart personality is beautiful nand needless to say must say that emmanuelle beart herself is beautiful nbesides the near ending the only other criticism of the movie which have is that the movie is almost too cerebral ni almost left with the sense little happened because almost all the changes which occur in the movie happen in deep in their psyches and little in their personalities or the situations which they end as part of nthe one question which am left with is while they have accepted their lot has their attitude towards love changed ni have several possibilities which believe the movie hints at but am unsure of which the director is espousing nin summary this movie is solely about the character growth of two characters who almost develop relationship nin the process we see their attitude towards life and other people nin itself do not believe un coeur is complicated movie nwhere it does become complicated is when we juxtapose the scenes of the movie into the greater walk of life where we as americans have preconceived american notions of relationship love and people ni do wonder how the movie translates when viewed within its native french culture nhowever bringing my american preconceptions enjoyed the film ni would welcome any comments about this movie from any who have seen it ',\n",

of eager moviegoers stretched around the block some anticipants having queued up well in advance to get good seat in the theater nthey need not have wasted their time nthe movie is billed as comedy but is surprisingly bereft of humor nthere are noticeable attempts at laughs but very few tries actually click ni wondered if there were jokes that wasn getting because m not from china but unfortunately my conclusion was that this lack of humor couldn be attributed to the cultural barrier either nkeep cool just isn very funny nthe prelude to the film was visit by keep cool producer who with the help of an interpreter regaled us of how in order to get the print to the festival in time an assistant hand carried it on the plane from china to hawaii nalthough the print made it the assistant luggage was lost ntoo bad that story wasn in the movie because it got big laugh nqu ying the film female lead was also on hand to give few comments nhowever whereas the producer politely made regular pauses in his dialog so the interpreter could bring us up to speed ms ying saw fit to say everything she had to say in one fast paced incredibly long tirade nit was dizzying good foreshadowing for the film nyou see keep cool is filmed almost totally with camera handheld by man with bad case of the shakes nat least that the way it seems since the camera is constantly moving ncinema verite is one thing but panning and shaking around until your audience has headache is another nalthough some might consider it form which helps give the viewer an idea of the anarchic state into which chinese youth is slowly growing found it thoroughly distracting and after while quite annoying nheadache as said nthe film is about young bookseller wen jiang who is after young woman qu ying nthey used to be romantically involved but the woman grew tired of him and left the relationship nthe first half of the film is about the young man plan to win her back nof course the thing is she doesn want to be won back and has nightclub owner friend of hers rough him up bit nin the fight the young man grabs laptop computer belonging to bystander and attempts to use it to fend off his attacker but only ends up smashing it against lamppost nwe later find out that the laptop belongs to an older man who wishes to get his damaged computer replaced nthere is funny scene the only one in the film where the young man tries to use some twisted logic in order to get the older man to seek out the nightclub owner baotian li in order to recoup his losses nthere is no sense to be made out of the young woman behavior cold one minute caring the next so we feel no sympathy for her character nthe bookseller would be better off without her nalthough the second half of the film causes us to lose lot of sympathy for the young bookseller as well who is obsessed with chopping off the nightclub owner hand as revenge for the beating he took it also offers us some nice interaction between the bookseller and the older man nwhile the bookseller is blinded by his thirst for revenge the older man is the voice of reason and tries to rationalize each situation nhis quest to end the dispute peacefully and equitably is the one we identify with but it is frustrating to see that he seems to be talking to brick wall half the time na friendship develops between the two men but it occurs too late in the film for the audience to appreciate nalthough only an hour and half in length keep cool contains extraneous material nthe whole plot of how the bookseller is after the young woman could have been taken out since we don see her from the midpoint on na case of mistaken identity or some other device could have served as the point of conflict between the bookseller and the nightclub owner and would have saved us from the bookseller boring pursuit during the first half nbut of course this would have shortened the movie to less than an hour nthere are few things that keep cool does right nas mentioned before the interaction between the bookseller and the older man is generally pretty good nalthough it grows tiresome the reasoning with the unreasonable is nice exercise in logic and represents the differences in thinking between generations nin one scene for example the bookseller quotes confucius to get his point across but the older man claims the quote was misinterpreted and that it means something entirely different nalso effective is the way zhang sets up tension within scene such as when the bookseller is getting ready to cut off the hand of the unwitting nightclub

tell you what happened in detail nit becomes real education in what agencies get involved and how theories are suggested and what kind of pressure the investigators are under and just about any other aspect you can think of nfrequently get the feeling that the article sounded exciting but am being told in more detail than really wanted to know noften get to the middle of story and say ok it sounded good but now have invested more time than am willing to spend on this subject nfilm is different medium nit is visual medium nthat slows down the telling of stories much more than people realize ni frequently am surprised to find out how short film script is and how much of the pages are empty space nthe magazine article and the film script are two very different media nthe insider is film adaptation of the vanity fair article the man who knew too much by marie brenner nit is too much an adaptation of magazine article slowed to the pace of film nit really verges on being tedious at least at times nfor years the seven big companies knew that they dealt in an addictive drug that caused host of unhealthy side effects nbut they pretended for the public that it was unproven and they did not really believe it nthe business was incredibly profitable and the proceeds translated into the political power to squelch and discredit any political movements against big tobacco nthe tide turned when former vice president of one of the companies was convinced by the cbs 60 minutes news team to tell the public how much the tobacco companies really knew about the health effects of smoking nthe resulting pressure to stop the story created small civil war at cbs nwho were the major people involved what were their motives how was the story almost killed how did it get aired anyway nthat is the story covered in surprising detail by the insider nthis all could have been enthralling but it is not the sort of thing that stylist like michael mann would be likely to do well nand in the end he failed nto make long story short the film needed director who knew how to make long story short nthe film opens with the cbs 60 minutes team in iran with the assignment to interview terrorist nwe get taste for their personal style and how they get the upper hand nthey go from being one newsman blindfolded at the hands of the terrorists to the actual interview with mike wallace played by christopher plummer nthere the news team under producer lowell bergman al pacino are ordering around the terrorists and getting away with it nthis seems to have nothing to do with the main line of the story but later when the tobacco industry is so much harder to manipulate than committed terrorists we have wry irony on who really has clout in the world nterrorists can grab the headlines but the tobacco companies have the real position of power nincongruously intercut with the iran interview sequence we see jeffrey wigand russell crowe dejectedly returning from work to his home nwe discover that he has been fired and his career brought to complete halt unexpectedly nhe had been very profitably rewarded vice president in charge or research and development at brown and williams tobacco now he was unemployed and needed money to support his family nrather than support him his wife liane diane venora demands of him what are they supposed to do for income nmeanwhile the 60 minutes team trying to do story on fires started by cigarettes have obtained some data they do not understand nthey offer wigand 12 000 just to interpret the data nwigand severance agreement swears him to secrecy about anything he knows about tobacco dealings but he is reluctantly he stretches the severance terms nhe is willing to read some documents from another tobacco company and interpret them for bergman nin spite of the secrecy wigand former employers seem immediately to know wigand is talking to 60 minutes and he is warned off by former boss thomas sandefur played michael gambon in an all too brief but deliciously sinister role nand so the game begins nwigand is irate at his negative treatment for what he still considered continued to be loyalty to his agreement and his former employer nmeanwhile someone is playing very rough with wigand and his family nthe film examines wigand and the pressures placed on his family as they are caught between two powerful giants nwigand has always wanted to make tobacco safer and has natural sympathies with getting the story out nhe and his family are assaulted psychologically and financially by the giant tobacco industry that had never lost legal fight nal pacino is given top billing but the wigand family is the core of the insider nthe story is told slowly and in just bit too much meticulous detail nthe film is 157 minutes and is an extremely demanding film for the audience nthe musical score by pieter bourke lisa gerrard and graeme revell is one of the worst in recent memory nit puts ominous chords under some scenes and using voice in ways that become distraction that gets in the way of the storytelling nalso disturbing is the casting of christopher plummer as mike wallace nplummer and wallace are such different types and wallace is too well known for even so good an actor as plummer to play him convincingly nthis film might have been really engaging experience under another director control nmichael mann was the wrong person to helm this film and the insider lacks intensity because of his style ni rate it 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and 0 on the 4 to 4 scale ',\n",

next to be just like them not that you could be next to die nthe film introduces us two three different characters who in the beginning are considered outsiders because they re not yet part of this clique the new kid steve james marsden dull dull dull dull who having trouble at home because he hasn gotten over his brother ethan embry in quick flashes so you don recognize him did suicide the renegade girl rachel katie holmes from dawson creek who chief personality trait is her prominent nose ring and by far the most interesting kid gavin nick stahl the kid from the man without face who the most interesting because he the only character who given some dimension nin the film best scene he introduces steve to every single clique nailing each one fetishes and hang ups and it the best scene in the movie because it witty satirical and interesting something the rest of this film isn ngavin suspects there something awry with the preppie kids known as the blue ribbons and in the tradition of all conspirators and even when he actually shows hard pure evidence to steve he only treated as typical raving conspiracy buff nhere we have another case of the idiot plot where not only could steve had done something about gavin and what happens to him but he may have saved this film from being the dreary dull film that it is without gavin who gives it life and humor nthe only other half interesting character is the school janitor played by william sadler as retarded scary guy who may not be what he seems to be but nreally we don care anyway ni probably shouldn mention that this was directed by david nutter who works for the files because that would probably tarnish his reputation nlike the show he good at setting up weird conspiracies and creating general creepy feel nmost of this film is shot at night and with dark eerie shadows for the maximum creepy effect and some of it works nbut what this film is not so good at is coming out with good payoff nhe keeps too much inside so much that when the characters journey to mental institution in the third act you wonder why they just don get the hell out of there ni think what happens to gavin is proof enough that there something rotten in the state of teen angstdom nwhat this film needs to be is lot longer lot more colorful and lot creepier nif the best villain they can come up with is guidance counselor played by bruce greenwood an atom egoyan regular obviously just trying to pay the rent who still thinks he can get away with it even when most is revealed then they need to come up with tougher smarter villain nif he so villainous then why could two dense teenagers who couldn figure out there was something going on until it was way too late find information on him in couple minutes nthe film which runs about 80 or so minutes just needs to work on these things and become lot less sloppy nat such short running time and with such lame boring characters as these it pretty much obvious that leaving this

entertaining if not particularly enlightening biopic of hustler publisher and self made millionaire larry flynt who became an unlikely champion of freedom of speech rights in the united states in the late 1970s and early 1980s nthe film unweaves its tale in chronological order we open with young and dirt poor larry flynt and his brother jimmy peddling jars of water in true entrepreneurial spirit out in the rural outback of kentucky ncut to forward in time where the two flynt brothers now young men are running the struggling hustler go go clubs in cincinnati nthe strip clubs are in dire financial state and in last ditch effort to salvage the operations flynt decides to go to print shop and churn out promotional newsletter nthis evolved into the adult periodical _hustler_ magazine creating larry flynt vast financial empire and the rest is history nwhat sets flynt apart from other publishers is his struggles against those who would have him cease publication of his adult material and who railed and preached against him flynt spent time in incarceration and was paralyzed by an assassination attempt and his driven single minded insistence to buck the system and fight for his freedom of expression regardless of personal cost nthe people vs nlarry flynt also weaves in the bittersweet story of flynt true love althea leasure whom he meets as dancer in his club and later marries and who devotedly stands alongside him throughout his trials and tribulations nconsidering the serious nature of the film theme the importance of the united states first amendment the people vs nlarry flynt is surprisingly and wonderfully light hearted and humourous nmuch of the comedy is elicited from larry flynt outlandish stunts at his courtroom appearances some of his chosen apparel is hilarious and for the most part these elements of the film work far better than some of the more dramatic points such as an uninspiring flynt monologue set at free speech rally in front of an enormous american flag dealing with the subjectivity of obscenity nthe film focus is on the flynt many battles over first amendment rights and freedom of speech but the heart of the people vs nlarry flynt is the touching love story between flynt and althea nlarry flynt is shown as being occassionally gruff harsh and overtly aggressive with his friends and colleagues but with althea we see his loving affectionate side nthere a scene where flynt tenderly takes his ill wife on ride on his wheelchair that is heartbreaking nultimately the emotional power that the film hits at its conclusion comes not from his achievements from his battles against censors but from the strength of flynt and althea love for each other nwoody harrelson is entirely engaging in what must be certainly career topping performance as the irrepressible larry flynt nharrelson plays flynt with the right mixture of outrageousness and confident stubborness to make him endearing and entirely sympathetic to the audience and very compelling protagonist for the film ncourtney love plays althea leasure in startling turn completely raw and impulsive nit a very solid performance brash and naturalistic and love is extremely compelling it difficult to take your eyes off her onscreen and her chemistry with harrelson is dead on nedward norton as flynt straight level headed lawyer is often upstaged by his flashier co stars in the people vs nlarry flynt much as his counterpart lawyer alan isaacman was upstaged by flynt during many of the courtroom scenes but norton shines in his big scene where he addresses the supreme court in the climactic scene of the film none can sense the frustration that norton character feels when harrelson free talking flynt sabotages trial after trial on him by openly speaking his mind and this results in heightened emotional punch when norton isaacman has the opportunity to sway the supreme court judges nmilos forman keeps the film moving although it runs over two hours it never drags and his direction of the film is very effective eliciting great deal of empathy for subject which could be construed by some as extremely sordid and unsympathetic nthere also great visual technique which forman uses to indicate the passing of time in one shot which is both clever and extremely entertaining ntwo minor quibbles with the film it certainly seems like the people vs nlarry flynt is in rush to get to its main theme with flynt battling against authorities and the system for his freedom of speech nconsequently the first thirty minutes of the film introducing and setting up the characters seem unduly rushed perhaps it is merely due to the fact that these characters are so interesting but felt it would have worked better if this route was taken in more leisurely fashion nit also felt like there was distinctive lack of insight into the inner workings of these characters the film clearly shows what flynt althea isaacman and rev jerry faldwell did and on superficial level some of their motivations but it never seemed like one could really understand the characters on deeper level nfor example why larry flynt was compelled by ruth carter stapleton president carter sister to be born again is mystery to me nthen again perhaps it was to him as well nthese two points don detract greatly from the film nthe people vs nlarry flynt is certainly among the very best studio released films of 1996 and works both as ringing political statement about the importance of freedom of speech and the depths to which larry flynt would go to advance the cause of free

              " 'the cryptic teaser trailer has been unspooling in moviehouses for quite sometime now it mu5t be found nso what exactly is the fifth element nafter seeing luc besson ambitious much shrouded in secrecy science fiction fantasy could not help but be let down by the actual answer which is not nearly as exciting nor clever as one would think nbut what is far from letdown is the film as whole wildly imaginative feast for the senses that does what all the best science fiction films do create universe unlike any other presented on the silver screen nthe biggest irony of the fifth element is that the one thing that has been kept under such tight wraps the actual storyline is the most conventional dismayingly so element pun intended of the film nspeaking in the vaguest possible terms the basics of the plot are as follows in the year 2259 great force of evil threatens to consume the earth and only the four elements earth wind fire and water united with fifth element can stop it nfiguring into all of this are new york cabbie korben dallas bruce willis shady southern drawling entrepreneur by the name of zorg the hilariously hammy gary oldman picking up where he left off in besson the professional priest ian holm and mysterious creature named leeloo milla jovovich nall of the pieces come together in tidy and somewhat underwhelming and unsurprising fashion but there is no denying that this basic story holds some intrinsic interest nwhat remains interesting and exciting however after brief glimpses is the fascinating world besson has created with production designer dan weil director of photography thierry arbogast visual effects supervisor mark stetson and the crew at digital domain nthe look is absolutely mesmerizing right from the opening moments to the last nthe frenzied cityscape of new york with its vibrant day glo colors tall buildings penetrating high into the clouds and the swarm of cars cabs and other vehicles flying through labyrinthian skyways is absolutely breathtaking to behold especially in wild car chase sequence early on in the film nbut it would not have been completely captivating vision if the people inhabiting the settings weren equally as interesting and are they ever nin addition to the exotic menagerie of alien creatures that populate this world from bulky robots to dog like mangalores the humans are outfitted in costumes by eccentric designer jean paul gaulthier best known for creating madonna pointy bustier get up in her blonde ambition tour ngaulthier outlandish creations such as number worn by leeloo made entirely out of white straps feel more at home in besson futuristic vision than on any fashion runway in the world they add to the sense of otherworldliness about the film nwhile besson bold vision is the biggest virtue of the film it also could be its biggest obstacle to reaching mass audience nfor all its imagination certain things about the film may be bit too quirky and bizarre ni really do not know what middle america will make of the most outrageous character of the film ruby rhod chris tucker flamboyant disc jockey who makes dennis rodman look conservative he makes raucous entrance dressed in an animal print dress sporting blonde hairdo in the shape of hair dryer speaking in high pitches at rapid fire speed nat first this character hyper energy is funny but the act wears out its welcome very quickly nnot irritating but just as strange is musical number by blue skinned alien chanteuse diva maiwenn lebesco who sings and dances an aria that is an unlikely blend of classical opera and techno nthe tune as with the entirety of longtime besson collaborator eric serra innovative score is haunting but it is also completely jarring nthen there are the campy touches of humor besson and co scripter robert mark kamen sprinkle throughout which too often are silly and forced comic sexual encounter between ruby rhod and flight attendant is highly distracting and not very funny to boot nthe story weakness shines through in the climax and conclusion of the fifth element nwhile still visually and aurally spectacular the events detailed are not as exciting nor powerful as they should be nthe big serious dramatic climax was met with more than few snickers and it ambitiously strives for profundity which the film had not even begun to work toward nas such at the end there is sense that there was something bigger at work here that there was still more left to be said about this story and these characters nthis suspicion was confirmed by besson himself who told me in the lobby following the screening imagine that the filmmaker watching the film with the enemy the critics that what had made it to the screen was really just the first half of the lengthy original fifth element screenplay and that the second half now titled mr shadow is still waiting to be made nstill despite the story problems the fifth element is an artistic triumph for luc besson rarely does filmmaker original vision come to the screen in all its audacious undiluted glory nit is fascinating example of how of one artist fervid imagination can transport an audience into an intoxicating fantasy world generally seen only in dreams ',\n",

greatest strength was that the most important events happened offstage prior to the movie during the movie and after the movie nand that after bringing all the plotlines together neatly it left the viewer with full knowledge of what would happen in the characters future so there was no need to film it nthere was actually about four hours worth of screen story there but eszterhas found ways to get it all on screen in two by leading his audience into analyzing what was really going on and by still holding their interest with clever misdirection and false trails nthe major elements that made basic instinct work so well are present in showgirls nwe have attractive sympathetic but still highly repellent characters we have shows for the eyes and the ears plotlines that play on several levels

station in life who slips into behaving the way those around her do nbut recovers with flourish and quits winner nin this sense the movie is bit of departure for verhoeven who not known for treating his characters well but nomi the part played by elizabeth berkley definitely opts out of the game in positive way and we re left feeling good about her future nthis is not one of the great movies but it far better than we been led to expect by all the negative pre release publicity nverhoeven got his first oscar nomination in 1971 and in the last quarter century has pushed farther and farther

contained specific provision that he would not have to deliver an rated movie verhoeven had to cut several parts of basic instinct to get an rating although his original version is available on video

the value system she ll be using for the rest of her life and nomi feelings for molly are the spur that forces nomi decision ngina gershon plays cristal an aging but still very attractive starring dancer reflexively competitive manipulator who become villainess by internalizing the ethos of the crooks and scum around her ngershon plays cristal as cross between ava gardner and raquel welch fading talent made bitter by self awareness nher character is very well drawn and performed in major scene in hospital room she acknowledges what she is and in essence passes the torch to nomi nthe relationship between the two of them is the most honest one in the movie and provides part of the impetus nomi needs to follow different path nit is no accident that the three important parts in this

compromised her ideals and sold herself to be co operating part of the system exchanging self respect for the species of stardom that can be had in las vegas nnomi believes she can make it without

be possible to call drifting clouds satire or black comedy but that would imply sense of anger of vitriol of energy drifting clouds is what you get when the rage and vitality are gone nit is the sad slow story of lauri and ilona married couple caught between the wheels of capitalism as it grinds inexorably onward nhe loses his job as tram driver because everyone drives cars nowadays nwithin couple of months she loses her position as head waiter when her restaurant is bought out by chain and the entire staff replaced na conversation early in the film reveals lot about their situation

payments will be done and then they can buy some books for the shelves nit would pass as deadpan humour if it wasn spoken with such resigned weariness nthis sets the tone for the rest of the movie nthere is humour and idiosyncracy at the periphery but at the centre there is frustration and futility and sorrow for the ways in which the logic of profit reduces people until their worth is equated solely with their earning capacity nthere is an element of political commentary in this critique of the mechanisms of capitalism and the stultifying social environment it creates but in drifting clouds the political is subsumed by the personal the movie is about two people and what happens to them and nothing else matters nlauri and ilona live lives starved for friendship respect culture passion nthey go to the movies and walk out past old posters for atalante and argent but the movie they have just seen is pointless violent unfunny comedy ntheir house and workplaces are uniformly unpleasant painted and upholstered in lifeless colours ugly greens dull reds insipid blues full of inelegantly functional objects and appliances nthe art design is impeccable in its tawdriness and director aki kaurism ki often matches the colour of characters clothes with the background colour and or lighting so that it seems as if they are almost physically fading into the environment nthere is no suggestion of sexuality in the relationship ilona and lauri sleep in separate beds and their gestures of affection lack the heat of desire their lives are now bound by something more complex and desperate than love ntheir downward downsized downtrodden lives have momentum that is almost comic as one setback succeeds another bottoming out when lauri stakes all their remaining money on the spin of roulette wheel nit must have been tempting to play the story for more laughs more farce more deadpan wit but the film great strength is the sober empathic manner in which it observes lauri and ilona misfortunes nirony would be an injustice nsituations and settings are broad and exaggerated this is not realism but they are not distorted nthe emotions are authentic nif it is difficult to laugh at anything that happens despite the droll performances the laconic humour that because kaurism ki brings such compassion and understanding to the manifold indignities that are suffered nhe shows us how humiliating it must be for woman of thirty eight who has worked long and hard to win respectable position to be forced to accept job as dishwasher in two bit restaurant how humiliating it must be for man nearing 50 to confront his wife former employer demanding the rest of her wages only to have the crap beaten out of him unable to land single punch when the employer and his cronies refuse to give him the money nall this is observed keenly with great economy every cut every line of dialogue is judicious nif most films are novelistic in their telling this one brings the focus and concentration of short story to bear nbut what is gained in nuance and acumen is rather undermined by the sense that the material barely accommodates the 96 minute running length ni have seen many

merely less marketable which is shame because this is movie which should be seen precisely because it pays attention to people and emotions that most movies prefer to ignore nit engages us and touches us and resolves surprisingly and movingly into something resembling happy ending nthe only thing greater than the ill luck that governs the characters lives is their refusal to give in to despair

trilogy nyou also may have heard that this one too kiddie friendly and doesn have enough content for adults nbelieve the hype nthe effects are stunning the digitalized creatures are amazingly realistic the lightsaber duels are amazing and queen amidala sumptuous robes are fit to be worn by queen elizabeth nbut there something missing here and it isn budget or effects it everything money can buy nthe actors struggle as best they can to flesh out broad stroked and flat characters nthe most successful at this is liam neeson who as qui gon jinn jedi master to young obi wan kenobi has quiet dignity and wise commanding presence nhe is the anchor to this movie as he is the one character who george lucas apparently spent some time fleshing out nportman queen amidala and mcgregor obi wan kenobi don fare nearly so well namidala the future mother of luke and leia and the queen of peaceful planet being invaded by the trade federation comes off as stoic stilted and caricatured it appears as though she was vulcan geisha in former life nand obi wan although mcgregor makes him very endearing has so little screen time that he nothing but robin to qui gon jinn batman nhowever mcgregor does struggle manfully to infuse this surprisingly small supporting role with spark of genuine insight and humanity and he does good job nhe also absolutely nails alec guiness obi wan in episode 4 6 scottish accent and that really makes his presence in the film more profound than it might have been otherwise nin fact lucas seems to bank on that preexisting knowledge quite bit and that one of the problems with this film ni would never call myself star wars fan especially not considering what it means to be fanatic these days but ve always enjoyed the films along with everyone else in america nhowever if you are the one person in america who hasn seen the films at all or even recently or who doesn bother to brush up on the names of obscure characters you may be hopelessly lost nfor example one of the film main nefarious characters is senator palpatine nfor those of you not recently steeped in star wars trivia emperor palpatine is that scary hooded apparition who was darth vader master in return of the jedi and empire strikes back nso obviously his appearance in phantom menace is meant to stir some echoes of his later role in the series thus making his role here more meaningful na lot of the movie is like that nr2 d2 and 3po make token appearances and it obvious that lucas is banking on the audience pre existing fondness for them nbecause he doesn do much to add to it in any way nsame goes for jabba the hutt who doesn look as much mean here as he does corpulent and lazy neven planets make foreshadowing guest appearances in this film tatooine the desert world where luke grew up coruscant the cloud city from empire strikes back and alderaan leia home planet which we never actually see that gets blown up in star wars show up or are mentioned briefly in passing nwhat the result of tying so many plot points and characters to future films nthe answer is that this one seems surprisingly empty nthere no meat no substance that makes you want to love the characters as they are not as they will be nanother problem is that there are actually too many alien characters in the film ni was distracted by the fact that two of the main evil characters strange looking aliens who looked like gila monsters had mouths that barely moved making them look more like muppets than actual characters nand jar jar binks silly roger rabbitish amphibious character is intended as comic relief but what he really becomes is annoying and fast nunlike chewbacca and 3po who got their humanity if you ll pardon the expression from their interactions with the human characters jar jar is often left to interact mostly with others of his kind at times making the movie seem like nothing more than very expensive teenage mutant ninja turtles nfurthermore the dialogue is often stilted and corny and sometimes downright infantile thereby rendering some characters into nothing more than bystanders to the plot noddly this isn just my judgment lucas has said that he designed this film for kids nwell he done good job nthe hero of this film of course is young anakin but it was very hard for me to feel any kinship or identify with an eight year old boy nthat not jake lloyd fault though he does good job of being cute kid which is apparently all lucas asked of him nthat another mistake of course because the cute tyke becomes darth vader nwarning spoilers ahead nin my opinion there was not nearly enough foreshadowing of anakin future evil in the film nthe boy is all blond flowing hair and rosy cheeks and there nothing more than spark of aggression in him throughout the entire movie nhe has doting mother pernilla august making her first english language film and is slave to gross flying gnome on tatooine nbut the only indication the audience gets that this kid isn all hearts and roses is yoda hesitation in allowing him to train as jedi under qui gon jinn nhis explanation his future is clouded warning major spoiler ahead nenter at your own risk nof course the noble qui gon dies at the hand of darth maul scary looking sith lord who excels at the jedi arts but has turned to the dark side nthis dude has maybe two lines in the entire movie but he establishes his presence through his amazing moves with his double sided lightsaber and his scary facial makeup nbecause qui gon never gets chance to train the young anakin in the ways of the force obi wan qui gon young padawan apprentice one level below knightdom must take over the training himself nso at the end of the movie we end where the saga actually begins with obi wan kenobi and his young apprentice anakin darth vader skywalker ndid this story need to be told ni would say no nbut is it worthwhile movie to see nabsolutely nif you don enter the theater with jedi size expectations and you simply want to be treated to an enjoyable visual spectacle then this is your movie nthe tatooine pod races are triumph of effects and computer animation nthe digitalized backgrounds on some of the planets are an astonishing sight nand yoda and young obi wan are worth seeing for their origins in simpler happier time nabove all this is fun movie nnot deep not meaningful and not profound nbut fun nmaybe next time lucas will hire lawrence kasdan to co write the script and the guy who directed empire will direct nbecause if lucas does the next one himself it will be lacking the one thing it needs the most potential n ',\n",

              " 'let me start off by saying that leading up to the release of the latest bond film really wasn looking forward to it as much as have with some of the previous films ni not sure if it was the fairly lackluster trailers or the ever present dread that the next film will fall back into the miserable ways of the timothy dalton years ni happy to report that any doubts were erased after about the first 10 minutes of the film nby that point it was evident that mr bond was back with vengeance nall doubts would have probably been erased sooner except for the fact that the first ten minutes of the film weren exactly pleasant experience nit seems that nobody told the geniuses working at the theater that the house lights are supposed to be turned off when the movie starts nit took reminder from an audience member to clue them in ni guess they can be excused though taking tickets and cleaning up popcorn between shows is extremely taxing on the brain nanyway after somebody remembered what the light switch was for settled in for bond ni think the most noticeable aspect of this the 19th film in the series is that it really goes back to the almost tongue in cheek style of the roger moore films nthere were probably more one liners in this movie than in the last several combined nand bond last one liner in the film is about the best of the series nthe world is not enough also contained perhaps the most action of any movie of the series neverything from wild boat chases to the usual assortment of cool bond gadgets trotted out just when there seems to be no way out for 007 nfor the most part the action sequences worked very well nalthough there were couple of times that thought some things were bit over the top even for bond film ni think some of the blame can be laid at the feet of director michael apted nwhile he did good job for the most part there were points in the movie specifically during action sequences that he seemed to loose site of the fact that he was making essentially an action film nmost noticeably sequences on snow covered mountain and one involving bond getting through closing door looked like apted thought he was filming some sort of high brow art movie nhe almost seemed like he didn know what he was doing nbut they were brief scenes and really shouldn take away from the otherwise solid job that apted did in directing nif you have ever seen bond film you won be shocked to learn that plot has never been their strong suit nthe world is not enough is no exception nthis time we have yet another over villain that bond has to stop for the good of the world n007 matches wits with the terrorist renard robert carlyle man who has bullet lodged in his brain that makes him impervious to pain nwhy this point is included is beyond me nthey took great pains to explain his condition but it only came up later in the movie as scene that can only be described as looking like an afterthought nanyway renard like the typical terrorist that he is is bent on some harebrained scheme involving mid east oil pipeline ni guess world domination just isn as attractive to terrorists as money making venture anymore nbond is brought in to protect the pipeline owner elektra king sophie marceau who is the daughter of one of renard recent victims nalong the way bond has to enlist the help of nuclear scientist dr christmas jones denise richards and his old rival valentin zukovsky robert carlyle nlike all bond films you basically just have to suspend disbelief over the plot since it is ridiculous beyond words nmy biggest complaint would be that it was about the most disjointed of any of the bond films nthere was at least one point that had to stop and try to remember why bond was where he was and why he was doing what he was doing nthe buddy that saw the movie with was completely confused over an earlier kidnapping of marceau character nit was alluded to earlier in the movie briefly although not included in the film nlater it became big part of the story and left him with the distinct feeling that he had missed something nbut because it is bond film the beautiful women and nifty gadgets seem to make you forget about script problems quite quickly nafter all it isn shakespeare nhow about the cast nbrosnan seems to get better with each of his appearances as 007 ni grew up with the roger moore version of bond so really enjoyed the lighter style that brosnan brings to the character njudi dench as had bigger role in this film than in her two previous appearances in the role nshe brought the talent with her that one would expect from an oscar winner nrobbie coltrane was easily one of the best parts in goldeneye so it was nice to see his russian mobster character revived in this movie ncoltrane gets more screen time which simply leads to him stealing even more scenes nthen there are the bond girls nsophie marceau might be one of the most beautiful actresses working today nthere is just something about her breathtaking eyes that makes her natural to play the innocent victim nthose that saw her in braveheart know she is more than just pretty face nmarceau may be the most talented actress to ever play bond love interest nthen we have denise richards nthere was no doubt in my mind that she was cast exclusively for her looks nand after you see the outfits she wears you won have any trouble guessing what part of her anatomy caught the producer eyes ni was pleasantly surprised to find that she really did good job playing nuclear scientist nadmittedly there was one point that the audience snickered bit at one of her technical lines of dialogue but other than that she stacks up no pun intended to her bond girl predecessors nicely ni must say that the biggest disappointment was robert carlyle character nwhile carlyle did fine job with the material that he had his character just never worked for me nthe producers tried very hard to add more complexity to his character but it just never quite got off the ground ni guess was hoping for bit more regarding the whole impervious to pain aspect of his character but the writers decided to play up the emotional side of his character nthis might have worked well in another movie but don go to see bond movies for their deep characterizations nlast but not least we have desmond llewelyn as this is the 17th appearance for llewelyn as bond gadget guy and he is as good as ever nalthough his screen time has grown far more limited in the past few films he is still treat to watch nrumors abound that this may be his last appearance in the role nhe says future appearances are up to higher power nthe producers have introduced his protege and future replacement bumbling and somewhat pompous character played by comedy master john cleese nwhile we don see much of him in this film think it is fair to say that desmond llewelyn legacy whenever it is passed on will be in very capable hands nso how does it stack up ndespite some problems the world is not enough is very entertaining movie nand all things considered what problems it does have are small compared to some that have plagued earlier bond movies nthis is easily the best of the brosnan films nit may even be the best of the entire series certainly in the top 3 none thing is for sure even after 19 movies there is still plenty of life left in the james bond series nhere looking forward to bond number 20 ',\n",

clich by conveying the feel of authentic experience the intensity of lived pain and much of it seems trite and belaboured nit unfolds awkwardly as series of flashbacks told during luncheon in vienna

              " 'swear have seen the edge before nin fact it reminded me of the bear the river wild and other various films mixed into an entirely different film nhowever the edge has done something that most action films should do and that is add heart and characters we like to the plot nin doing so the edge draws many more suspenseful moments out of cliched scenes than say the peacemaker nunfortunately because of those overused moments we can pretty much guess the outcome of the film nbut leave it to screenwriter david mamet to add humor and few surprises to mess with your head none surprise in particular left me smiling just because mamet actually had the guts to add it to his script naction films are dime dozen in hollywood and while they are somewhat successful at entertaining us they lack the one thing which would make them more respected genre intelligence neven horror films have learned this genre which is probably the least respected of them all nthe river wild was one of the best action suspense films have seen from the 90s nthe intelligence of the screenplay and the suspense drawn from the realistic characters is nearly unmatched to this day nthe edge has the intelligence and smart characters but this time the lack of originality is the downfall ni must admit that it was very suspenseful and had an original third half but the first hour and half is riddled with cliches and plot holes nthis is an example of the final act saving the film instead of the other way around as in the lost world nif only the screenplay had maintained the final thirty minutes intensity it could have become great action film and use the term loosely nthe edge is pretty much survival of the fittest film nbut taking scream lead the edge makes fun of the genre cliches and then uses them though not quite as effectively ncharles morse anthony hopkins is the main character rich and very intelligent man who wonders what the accumulation of all this knowledge has brought to him nfor once we don immediately care for the main character ninstead we like bob alec baldwin photographer who is going to take pictures of charles wife mickey elle macpherson out in the wilderness nthey board plane and head to cabin somewhere in the arctic ncharles birthday is the same day and he receives gold watch from his wife and pocket knife from bob nas action films go these items do have importance to the rest of the story but quite bit more than we first expect nsoon however bob wants to find native to shoot pictures of because of his personality ncharles bob bob assistant steve harold perrineau and the pilot head off to find him and as shown in the previews hit flock of birds flying south for the winter ndown the plane goes the pilot is killed and the three are left to survive in the wilderness ndirector lee tamahori is aware of the silly plot which is about to follow and therefore has to create original ways to approach the situations nhe succeeds often enough for us to enjoy the film ntake for instance the entire man hunting bear plot nthis has been done many times in films with different animals and even bears nbut given the charles intelligence and bob uncertainty many of the cliches are given fresh twists neven charles himself seems to have seen these action films before nmy favorite line of the film comes from charles most people die in the wilderness because they didn do the one thing that could save their life nthinking ndespite the predictability of the main plot subplot develops late in the film which took me by surprise and made me smile when realized that everything isn as it seems anymore ni have to write cautiously as to not reveal this surprise so instead will avoid it entirely nthe first two thirds of the edge have many humorous moments to push it along and some of charles survival techniques seem possible even making fire from ice ntamahori is able to create lot of suspense from the stalking bear but whenever the bear is present the characters lose all sensibility ni have always wondered why characters in films walk over log to get across water nwhy not do what an intelligent person would and crawl across ni guess getting chased by bear makes your thought process turn off for while nthankfully we already have begun to care for the characters and so we let this small detail slide nbut some of the technical details are awkward such as the nice stitching done on the fur coat that charles and bob make where did they get thread and needles nthe acting of the film is highly above average for film of this nature and borders on phenomenal nanthony hopkins gives terrific performance creating his most likeable and layered character since remains of the day nhopkins usually brings greatness to his roles but here he exceeds at gaining the audiences sympathy something he definitely did not do in silence of the lambs nalec baldwin gives one of his best performances have ever seen it sure is better from his fair game nbaldwin can be good or bad character and here he succeeds at both in way nyou can never quite guess if he is nice or vllainous character until the end and baldwin is able to handle the double natured photographer nelle macpherson gives good performance albeit slight nshe isn in the film all that much but for the scenes she does have she handles as an actress not as model nharold perrineau is good actor and his scenes are nice and underplayed nhe is eliminated early and reveal nothing by saying this because it is inevitable and predictable nthe edge is rated for graphic violence some gore and language nsome of the violence is little too disturbing even for me nthis film is nice change from the mindless action most of us are used to but too many cliches bog it down ndirector tamahori has created very smooth and suspenseful action film out of recycled parts ndavid mamet script though has lot of humor to keep the first hour afloat and the acting is solid nthe best thing about the script is the ending which doesn end with the normal high strung action sequence but with small detail involving certain gift nit a nice touch considering what we have had to go through with the bear nand by the way most people laughed when the film faded to black due to large credit to bart the bear nway to go bart ',\n",

the land of prydain there was king so evil that his spirit was captured in the cauldron nit has been hidden for centuries and whoever possesses it will have the power to conjure up an army of deathless warriors and with them rule the world and destroy it nthen we meet farmer wizard dallben and his young apprentice taran ntaran dreams of being warrior instead of being pig keeper they have pig named hen wen none day as he gives hen wen nice warm bath the pig goes crazy and dallben then realizes after watching hen wen thoughts through bucket of water that taran must hide hen wen in the forest nan evil ruler known as the horned king is searching for the black cauldron and only hen wen has the power to show its location ntaran leads hen wen into the forest but of course he loses her and tries to go find her nalong the way he meets up with mischievous little creature named gurgi who desires munchings and crunchings much to his dismay besides he stole an apple that taran was trying to use to bring back hen wen nwhen he hears hen wen squeal from far away though he races to her rescue only to see her get kidnapped by dragonlike gwythants ntaran chases after the gwythants and finds himself staring at the horned king castle from far away ntaran climbs the castle walls and brings himself into the castle where he attempts to rescue hen wen nhe manages to do so but he is himself captured and thrown into the dungeon nthere he meets princess eilonwy and her magic bauble another thing which the horned king was hoping to use to find the cauldron and the two escape through the deep castle walls nalong the way taran finds sword in burial chamber and they rescue comic bard named fflewdurr flamm who has harp whose strings break whenever he tells lie nthe three manage to escape the horned king castle but not before taran realizes that his sword is magic nas they rest in the forest gurgi reappears claiming to have found hen wen trail nhe leads taran eilonwy and fflewdurr by way of pig tracks to whirlpool nsuddenly they all get sucked under and they meet the fairy like fairfolk ntaran is reunited with hen wen and informed that the black cauldron is hidden in the land of morva nhe then devises crazy idea that if they can destroy the cauldron it would prevent the horned king from destroying their world nwith the help of grumpy fairy named doli the four travelers manage to find themselves at mysterious cottage nit turns out to be no ordinary cottage three comically strange witches inhabit the place nwhen taran tells them that they are searching for the black cauldron they agree to let him have it in exchange for his sword ntaran agrees much to eilonwy horror but at least they get the black cauldron nbut the cauldron can be destroyed only its evil powers can be stopped nthe only way to do so is for living being to climb into it of his own free will never to return alive nthings take turn for the worse when the horned king henchmen capture taran eilonwy and fflewdurr along with the black cauldron and lead them back to the castle ntaran eilonwy and fflewdurr watch in horror as the horned king unleashes the supernatural powers of the cauldron to ressurect his army of deathless warriors this is the most horrifying scene in the film because here dead army comes alive njust when all seems lost though gurgi reappears and rescues taran eilonwy and fflewdurr ntaran is about to jump into the black cauldron but gurgi stops him not wanting him to throw his life away ngurgi then jumps into the black cauldron and the deathless warriors decay ntaran tries to find way to rescue gurgi but he is forced to do battle against the horned king nhe kicks the horned king away who is then magically sucked into the black cauldron where its powers immediately destroy

where hen wen brought home by the fairfolk once the dangers are past dallben and even doli await their triumphant return nas spectacular as it sounds the black cauldron really suffered lot in its past times nbefore ron miller was fired from his position as chairman of walt disney productions he had bought novel by lloyd alexander called the black cauldron sword and sorcery tale for the studio nbringing this book to the screen was the studio fondest dream nmiller who entitled himself as the executive producer promised that they would do so after they had proved themselves on other projects nwhen micheal eisner and his executives arrived at the disney animation studio the animators were struggling to complete the black cauldron nby this time things had gone really rocky for the animation department nmany of the studio old men had retired or died ntherefore the animators suffered hard time making this film noriginally budgeted at 25 million the costs raised to 40 million because of constant changes on everything and when it was finally released on june 24 1985 the black cauldron was greeted by praising reviews from some critics but somehow the film flopped nthe film was rated pg and the film although disneyfied from lloyd alexander chronicles of prydain which is what this film is based on was much more scarier and darker than disney other previous efforts such as the rescuers and the fox and the hound which is probably why so many people considered it too scary and stayed away from it nin addition other critics rejected it for having no heart and unmemorable compared to other disney animated features nbut whatever the real reason the black cauldron was financial disaster grossing only 21 million nthe failure of the film grounded the studio animation department and exiled the animation team to annex buildings in nearby glendale and it seemed like animated features would no longer become part of the studio reputation nthe next two disney animated features the great mouse detective and oliver and company although little more lighthearted than the black cauldron didn do much better although oliver and company grossed much more than the black cauldron and the great mouse detective nonly with the little mermaid did the studio regain its reputation for successful animated features nas for the black cauldron it was rereleased in some cities for temporary time under the title taran and the magic cauldron nfinally the studio locked the film in the film vault and denied that it ever even was released nbecause of all this you might ask yourself was the black cauldron really such bad movie nthe people who had seen the film didn think so nin fact many people had calls to buena vista home video requesting for the film but of course they denied it nfor while it seemed like the black cauldron would never be released to video until september 1997 disney released the black cauldron to video in the united kingdom nfew people imported the video from england and converted to ntsc including me and for those who hadn seen the film yet am included here they got quite treat nbut people who had bootleg copies of the black cauldron noticed that in the scene where the horned king raises his army of deathless warriors about 12 seconds of ghoulish looking skeletons were slightly trimmed so that the film would get u rating in the uk the rating means universal suitable for all ages kinda like their own version of nsomewhere online team of diehard the black cauldron fans signed petition that said bring back the black cauldron and because of that disney finally decided to release the video to the united states nbefore that time rumors online had been made that the video would be trimmed like the uk video so that it would get g rating and that they would add in songs nthose rumors were put to rest when the walt disney company announced that the black cauldron would be released in its pg rated version neven still when it was finally released to the us some reaction was mixed nsome felt that it was indeed cut but some felt that it wasn nbut these where only minor criticisms which seemed laughable since film that was absent for thirteen years was finally available nas for myself when saw the movie for the first time on converted ntsc video didn expect much at all nin fact had heard so many mediocre things about it that didn think the film would ever be such good film nmuch to my surprise when saw the first few minutes of the film was asking myself this is the same film everyone saw nthe one that flopped at the box office nthe one that critics and filmgoers alike called bad movie nthis doesn seem like all of the above ninstead it a classic in its own right nthe film has wonderful cast of characters nthere taran grant bardsley an assistant pig keeper who would rather be warrior than pig keeper the story hero nthe critics have said that taran is not likeable at all but the opposite is true nhe is brave loyal and eventually learns lesson about friendship later on nthere a likeable character here nnot that he the only likeable character in the film nthere gurgi john biner lovable little uh thing who remains loyal to taran even though they don quite hit it off at first nbut another likeable character is the bad guy comic henchman dwarf named creeper phil fondacairo who is loyal to the film imaginative and sinister villain the horned king voiced gruesomely by john hurt yet he also fears his neck nthe other characters including the sidekicks spunky but sweet princess named eilonwy and the comic bard fflewdurr flamm and three comically wicked witches who hide dark secret although pleasant and likeable aren quite as well rounded as they should be nthe story itself is an adventurous one quest involving the mystical pig hen wen the black cauldron itself and an army of deathless ones with everything hooking opening to spectacular finale nelmer bernstein music also tells the story perfectly in dark yet calming manner nthe animation itself is surprisingly good considering that this film was created in the darkest time of the studios neven though there are some occasional effects that are not quite good like the ground opening when the black cauldron rises out of the earth the animation overall is top notch noverall this film is an entertaining endeavor nfans unfamiliar to the lloyd alexander chronicles of prydain will get kick out of this one except young kids nthere are some extremely scary scenes which are more darker than disney other films although some consider the stampede sequence from the lion king and frollo observing esmeralda in the fires of hell in the hunchback of notre dame are just as scary which is the main reason why this film is rated pg nfans familiar to the lloyd alexander series will recognize the differences between the novel and the movie neven though it doesn have all of the ingredients of true disney film this film is classic in its own right and deserves far better chance than what it has been given nthat better chance has finally come nwhatever reason about why the black cauldron was such big failure seems to have disappeared and the film has finally achieved its place among disney most proudest achievements ni can help but think though whatever would have happened if the black cauldron was box office success ',\n",

year old bea bella has arrived for year stay with the self absorbed mother oblivious to how her daughters might be adjusting to this foreign experience while she is searching for change of life from her unfaithful poet husband she is not officially married to him and her cold one room london flat and is sort of looking for the eternal truth in the sunny climate of marrakech nat least she says she is as she is making some attempt to contact sufi sheikh there who has all the answers nshe has not planned things out too carefully having no money and the trip doesn seem like it much fun more like misadventure with some romance with local moroccan thrown in ndrugs world wide youthful phenomena during this period where many westerners came to morocco to smoke the good hashish found there and to live the good life cheaply and to be in spot where they did not have to worry about being hassled by the local authorities even though drugs are illegal there nbut this is not shown as one of her reasons for being here nin this film the subject of drugs is never broached only hinted at in an off handed but slurring way as the hippie commune is shown in negative light strumming on their guitars and bragging about the hits of acid they have taken neven the ones coming here for spiritual reasons to follow the mystical sufis seem lost following culture that is far different from where they were coming from nthe film is based on the novel that contained the autobiographical experiences of sigmund freud grand daughter esther freud who traveled here in the 1960s with her mother and sister nit is written by the director brother who has previously directed regeneration the playboys and trojan eddie nthe title of the film comes from the squealing giggles that saying hideous kinky gives the little girls nwith julia strapped for cash and not receiving needed check her husband often forgets to send her she is prevented from seeing the greatest living sufi who is located in algeria so instead she meets an acrobat street performer in the bazaar bilal said taghmaoui nhe becomes her lover taking the place of her husband as father figure for the girls nthe girls readily accept him and

attitude and wants to go home nthings go surprisingly sour when bilal takes them to stay in his small village nit seems only that bilal charm is matched by his shiftlessness as he has wife who still lives there nthis scene didn make too much sense as to why he would take them there knowing the situation unless the uneducated man was totally uneducated in the customs of his people also nbut doubt that nthe family is now stuck without money in backward area trying to decide what to do next as they hitch ride away from there with truck driver who nearly kills them when he falls asleep by the wheel nlucy takes it all in stride and has good disposition for travel while bea just wants to go to school and learn something and be normal girl nthe beauty of marrakech is matched by the terrific performance of kate winslet as the film accurately encapsulates the timeless city and its bustling street scenes expansive views illustrious mosques and grand sunsets nkate enacts the feel of what it was like to be westerner living out the countercultural experiences while awaiting to gather her sensibilities again and was fortunate enough to be able to go home the better off for her experiences as many drop out reluctantly had to do after their stay ran out of money and purpose nthe background music from groups like america and jefferson airplane provided further nostalgia for this easy to look at and easy to grasp film nthe only hope was that the two innocent girls would not be permanently harmed while on this sojourn venture that should be reserved only for those of college age or older who choose to go there for themselves nthe family travel which is on the edge has julia waking up screaming from dreams that are bleakly haunting but when she gets up all there is is this splendid emptiness all around her and vacuous life that is starting to bother her nthat marrakech is disarmingly gorgeous and that london is old hat to her is starting to wear thin in her thoughts nit will dawn on her when bea takes ill as she reflects on what the sufi guru tells her whom she finally meets and is driven to tears in his presence nhe is the guru who replaced the one she wanted to see but who died before she got chance to see him nthe new guru is grounded in reality something she is not grounded in and seems to tell her what she couldn comprehend from anyone else even comforting her by telling her that her tears are memories gift from god nthe film weakness was the empty feeling got from watching the story unfold in its risk free tenor she was there basically to be just escaping from her situation and how unappealing the love affair seemed between bilal and julia nthe storyline about helpless single parent detracted from the vibrant experiences many others of her same baby boom generation had during their trip to morocco who were taken in by the mystical culture of sufism teaching that has lot to offer its followers contrary to the impression the film might give seemed to pass her by nher knowledge of that trip is only surface deep at best nshe perhaps would have been better off not taking the kids along smoking some hashish and have been less assured of herself but to have behaved more like hippie and she wouldn have been so uptight all the time and had some fun on her journey nafter all the mystical trip is the journey nthe film strength is in how all the characters are shown for what they are and no one is that good or that bad or judged too harshly for their shortcomings nbilal is unreliable but is capable of generosity nthe little girls are precocious but they are lovable njulia the cornerstone the film is built on is mother who cares about the children but doesn know how to take care of them without unintentionally harming them nshe was trying to escape from reality and that by returning to london she has another chance to see if she can find the key to this world or whatever world she is looking for and should no longer have nightmares about where she at nthis is very freudian way to look at things as this sudden realization that things are not right puts an an end to her eastern hippie odyssey at least for the time being

              " 'glory starring matthew broderick denzel washington and morgan freeman is the true story of the 54th regiment of massachusetts the first black fighting unit recruited by the north during the civil war nbroderick plays robert gould shaw the young white officer who led the black soldiers into battle nshaw the son of well to do abolitionists hailed from boston high society nthe letters he wrote home to his parents during the war are on display at harvard and were evidently the inspiration for glory nas the film begins in 1862 shaw is captain in the northern forces nlike private eriksson michael fox in casualties of war shaw initially is naive and idealistic about the war that is until his company is attacked by enemy forces nshaw experiences first hand the horror and chaos of battle witnessing mass slaughter and receiving minor wound himself when bullet grazes his neck nsoon after his recovery shaw is promoted to colonel and assigned to enlist and train blacks in the war effort nglory is the story not only of colonel shaw but also of the black soldiers who laid down their lives to free their brothers from slavery nthe film periodically jumps between shaw point of view and the perspective of the black soldiers nthe movie introduces us to handful of black recruits and we follow them from their enlistment through basic training and finally into action nthe large black cast is uniformly outstanding especially washington who is electrifying as runaway slave with big mouth nhe is brash and pushy always getting into trouble and always looking for fight nhis bitter tough guy facade is really just mask for his loneliness and vulnerability nwashington provides much of the film intensity and emotional power nin one heartbreaking scene he is whipped for allegedly deserting the army nwhen he removes his shirt to receive the punishment you cringe at the sight of his back which is riddled with ugly scars from his days as slave nit makes your blood boil nthe humiliation of the beating is far more traumatic than the actual physical pain it brings tear rolls down washington cheek and will probably run down your cheek as well nthe episode becomes even more tragic when we learn that washington wasn deserting the army at all he left camp to look for shoes because his feet were covered with oozing sores nfreeman is as usual strong presence even in small supporting role nhe plays grave digger who has buried more white soldiers than he cares to remember nhe quickly becomes leader among the black soldiers holding the group together and serving as liaison to the white officers ncolonel shaw recognizes freeman leadership ability and promotes him to sergeant major making him the first black officer in the army nandre braugher makes an impressive film debut in the role of thomas searles free black who is one of shaw close childhood friends nsearles is educated and refined like white man prompting washington to nickname him snow flake nthe burning question is whether searles is tough enough to survive basic training and to kill in combat nthe road from marching drills to battle action is bumpy one for the black regiment nthe soldiers suffer innumerable hardships but somehow they never lose their morale nthe army treats the black soldiers like second class citizens subjecting them to racism and discrimination nthey are paid only 10 month whereas their white counterparts earn thirteen and for long time they have to go without shoes guns or uniforms nto make matters worse the white military hierarchy is extremely reluctant to allow the blacks into action preferring instead to use them for manual labor neventually however the regiment receives its boots uniforms rifles and right to fight thanks to the stubborn resolve of colonel shaw nshaw has absolute faith in his soldiers and he fights tooth and nail to get them what they deserve even if it means threatening general with blackmail nbroderick in fact is most convincing in the scenes where shaw stands up for the regiment nunfortunately however broderick uneven performance is in many respects the weak link in the movie nin an effort to look more mature broderick sports mustache and goatee and throughout the film he slips in and out of phony boston accent nhe is never altogether convincing as shaw since much of the time his emotions seem forced nthe film places too much weight on broderick character and not enough on the black soldiers who are more intriguing nglory regains lost ground with its harrowing depiction of war nthe movie shows the devastation of war without resorting to the unnecessarily graphic gore which marred born on the fourth of july nglory does not try to rattle you with nauseating blood and guts nexcept for few bullet wounds and one exploding head the film for the most part leaves the gore to your imagination which is not to say that the battle scenes in glory are timid nto the contrary they are chaotic and horrifying it just that director edward zwick the co creator of thirtysomething films them with far more subtlety and restraint than oliver stone could ever muster nthe key to glory is the group dynamic among the black soldiers nthe movie depicts some of but not enough of their customs and rituals nin one scene for example the soldiers motivate themselves by singing prayers around the campfire neach man has chance to relay few words of inspiration na couple of the movie most touching moments involve young black children looking up to the black soldiers with awe disbelief and pride nthe regiment greatest triumph comes when the soldiers distinguish themselves in battle thereby earning the respect of their white peers and earning the honor of leading the climactic assault on fort wagner nlike any war film glory has its share of gloom and despair but ultimately it proves to be truly uplifting experience and an important history lesson valuable reminder that despite what the history books say or more precisely what they do not say blacks played critically important role in the north victory over the south forever changing the evolution of america ',\n",

              " 'seen may 31 1999 on home video rented none of the best things about the movies is that they can make you really start to wonder and analyze things in your own everyday life that you might not have thought much of otherwise nwith some films it might be just secondary issue but with dark city what we get is nearly an entire film committed to philosophizing and theorizing about human memory and how it defines who we are which is poignant theme made through an absolutely beautifully constructed film with the kind of story and setting that could only happen in movie nthere an old role playing computer game called ja wherein the player takes on the role of man who can remember who he is where he is and how he got there nthe goal is to gather as many clues as possible to figure that out and along the way overcome conflict nthe premise to this film is not unlike that game only this time we don have control over the protagonist nwe begin by meeting seemingly ordinary man living in an extremely dark and dirty city actually it more than just the city it the whole reality that isn just that neo gothic look la batman blade runner but is so fully developed it almost different genre completely nlater he will learn that his name is john murdoch sewell but for now he has no idea what going on other than the fact something is not right nthe fact there a dead body in the corner goes to enhance the feeling of paranoia and mysterious hurried call telling him to leave immediately is also very chilling nthis opening scene alone goes long way to define the setting of the film and its bizarre horrific tone nthe man doesn know who he is nor where he going and it interesting to follow him since we the viewers have no idea either we can sympathize and identify with him nin fact this is the way all stories begin since it impossible to know the history of character their feelings values morals etc until after we ve observed them for while nbut in this case the total feeling of amnesia is an excellent tool towards characterization developing the mood and outlining the story neventually some semblance of plot begins to unfold as it appears that john is serial killer wanted by the police nwe met inspector frank bumstead hurt quiet unemotional soft spoken deadpan man who appears to have been on the trail of the killer for some time ntwo other important characters are also introduced dr daniel schreber sutherland neurotic psychiatrist who claims to be john doctor and emma murdoch connelly jazz singer dolled up to look like caraciture right out of the old dick tracy serials or any given leading lady of the old film noir movies nit was schreber who contacted john for reasons that are continually revealed throughout the course of the film nhe also contacts emma which further helps the film reveal what is seemingly complex mysterious back story nbut absolutely nothing is as it appears to be in dark city which is what makes it so fascinating throughout its continual scenes of confusion and vertigo neverything the filmmakers want us to see has some significance considering how intricate the detail is to every single shot its lighting art direction and overall production design they don seem to be able to afford any gratuities nhowever that might also be what keeping it from reaching its maximum potential nby continuing to follow john as he wanders around this strange place so much unlike the real world we know we come to realize that it all hoax neveryone in the city is the subject of an experiment being conducted by race of aliens to understand what makes humans tick in their efforts to somehow save themselves from extinction nbut as the film tagline says last night one of us went off nfor reasons that are never clearly explained it appears that john possesses telekinetic powers to can do pretty much whatever his mind can conceive process known as tuning nthe aliens which look like very old bald human men with pasty skin also possess the power en masse and use it to change the city every night at midnight nat the same time all the humans fall asleep and after the changes are made they awake and either continue where they left off or begin new life they have no idea they did not have until then nthis premise certainly is interesting and director and co screenwriter alex proyas is able to keep the film consistently mysterious in this regard nhe does provide some explanations such as that dr schreber is an assistant to the strangers because he somehow could synthesize memory into chemical form nthe aliens mix and match the memories of the city population to see who will change and who will not nin the process this creates for good deal of deep thought provoking philosophies that could be applied to the real world nhowever where the film errs is by not playing up the idea of memory versus the human heart as to what makes person who he or she is nthe main characters are all closely intertwined within the seemingly complex murder mystery which never actually happened yet when they start to go through some of the expected emotions it comes off as distant static and cold mediocre performances by hurt and connelly don help either nfor example john realizes emma is not and probably never was his wife so he does not feel an emotional bond to her yet in some scenes crucial to the film plot we are expected to believe they do have genuine love for each other which is also part of the film climax and ending nand that what proyas seems to be inferring with the film but never quite manages to convey in its fullest sense nironically this is what made his first film the crow work so well which had similar theme of struggling to find hope and the human spirit within nearly identical dark twisted world nwith dark city the messenger seems to be mistaken for the message nstill the film is by no means bad and is consistently entertaining and enjoyable nthere a lot to like here most notably the sheer visual look and style of it all which accounts for at least half the reasons the film is able to tell the story it does nthe story as whole is one of the most original to come out of hollywood in years dark city is what the movies are all about the escape from the real world ',\n",

slew of rip offs followed in the years thereafter nthat fad seems to be over but here comes christopher mcquarrie writing and directing the way of the gun that at first glance looks like another of those wanna be but upon closer inspection doesn look like anything comprehendable nit a crime story so wrapped up in its own little world it has claustrophobic atmosphere film that won allow the story much room to expand outside its handful of characters and somehow still manages to turn simple premise into something so complex its ridiculous ncomplexity should come as no surprise to anyone who familiar with mcquarrie he wrote the usual suspects which has become cult favorite despite little critical acclaim nthat film had great story and was well directed but had such an elaborate confusing screenplay it leaves many viewers scratching their heads after repeated viewings nyou have to wonder if mcquarrie really had everything mapped out or if he was going for the hollywood idea that if it really confusing and about criminals and cops that makes it fascinating nwith the way of the gun mcquarrie seems to be capitalizing on the same idea but this time the story is far less commercial shame because maybe that would have helped nthe film tells the story of two drifters with no ambition and barely reason to live but aren hell bent on death either played by ryan phillipie and benecio del toro nthey get lucky when they hear about scheme between big shot exec guy and his trophy wife who are going to have baby through in vitro fertilization nthey figure they can kidnap the surrogate mother played by juliette lewis and get nice ransom nalong the way we continually learn of the shady dealings between the exec his wife their hired goons and the bag man played by james caan the only actor in the film who looks like he knows what he doing nthe exec is some kind of money launderer so he obviously can call the authorities for help nhis goons and the bag man are on the kidnappers trail and each make different offers to get the mother back nthe exec son is doctor who also gets pulled into the fray and wants to make sure his patient is all right nmeanwhile each of these characters has something hidden up their collective sleeves and the double crosses secret love affairs and torrid pasts come as no surprise even though little of it has any relevance at all nmcquarrie doesn know the meaning of the word simple nhe seems to be more interested in showing us how clever he is than making good movie neverything has to be complicated and confusing so much so that it to the point of surrealism nnothing is what it seems in this reality it one of those movies where you get dropped right into the middle of the criminal world and are expected to know most of the industry rules and regulations nevery scene with caan character exemplifies this perfectly the kidnappers already know who he is and even chat with him getting into conversations about the business and how it works and we re hardly given clue as to what they re talking about nthese characters are probably supposed to be great criminal sketches but they re more like ideas ripped off from sketches found in david mamet trash nno one here really acts like real person and the story is even further removed from reality nit like dream without any appeal ntake the opening scene for example the phillipe and del toro characters are in parking lot across the street from bar or club counting their money and stuff nthey sit on brand new mercedes and the car alarm goes off the owner is waiting in line and yells at them to get away from his car but they don move nthe guy and his loud mouth potty mouth girlfriend and about 20 other people cross the street and gang up on them nyou think phillipe and del toro are going to pull out guns and scare them away but they don instead phillipe throws one punch and the two get beat down by mob nthere a lot of things didn understand about this scene first of all the owner of the mercedes isn some yuppie or old rich snob he like hippie straight out of the 60s nsecondly the two main characters seem to believe that they can actually take on the mob unarmed nlastly it serves no purpose in the long run because later in the film the two are packing more artillery than small country army nif they were suicidal they wouldn have gone on the kidnapping job in the first place and where they get all those guns is never explained either nthere a lot more could pick apart about this film but that would be an exercise in futility nwhat it all comes down to is that nothing here is what it seems which would be great if this movie were about pretty much any other story than what it is nabsolutely none of the characters are likable or believable nand it all coated with thin layer of black comedy which is good for chuckle here and there but this film is definitely not flat out black comedy and its use of such seems like desperate attempt to kill screen time nwith any film you see whether you like it or not you can at least understand what the appeal was to it why someone would want to make it and why someone would want to see it ni can say either

could have been decent if the studio hadn started tinkering with the director walter hill final cut causing him to want his name removed nmaybe m becoming softy nin any case didn find supernova as bad as the advance buzz would have me believe nbut it still bad nthe film takes place aboard the medical space vessel nightingale nthe crew includes captain j nmarley robert forster his new second officer nick vanzant james spader head medical officer kaela evers angela bassett medical technicians yerzy penalosa lou diamond phillips and danika lund robin tunney and computer technician benj sotomejor wilson cruz nthere are some attempts at characterization but all that means is that nick has shady past involving drug addiction which puts kaela on edge yerzy and danika have relationship that requires them to make kissy faces at each other every five minutes and benj apparently gay is in love with the computer apparently female ndon expect any more explanation because you won get it nanyway the crew gets distress call from location deep in space to which failed mining operation had been sent nduring the dimension jump think that what it called but don hold me to it the captain is killed and the man who sent the distress signal peter facinelli is brought on board nhe calls himself troy larson making him the supposed son of man kaela once had relationship with nthen bunch of really predictable stuff starts happening nhave you seen alien nhave you seen event horizon lame movie in its own right ngood nthen you ve seen supernova npost production cuts or not there is nothing original about this screenplay and nothing unpredictable either nafter all no one going to think for second that troy won turn out to be villain nbut the bigger problem with supernova is that it can just stick to the simple plot it afforded nnumerous re writes the script may be credited to three people but it a gross underestimate have crammed this lean 90 minute film with tons of extraneous plot threads that all remain underdeveloped nwas there something about limping robot shaped like fighter pilot ndid the ship computer learn something about humanity nwhat was that glowing lava lamp artifact troy brought on board with him nand just what does the film title signify if anything nas far as can tell it refers to very small plot detail that isn developed just like the rest of these unnecessary story elements ncharacter relationships in this film also make very little sense nfor some reason every person in this film keeps having sex nwe get an unusually early sex scene between phillips and tunney within the first 10 minutes nbassett and spader characters start off hating each other nfifteen minutes and one bottle of pear brandy later they re engaging in some hanky panky nwhen troy the creepy stranger shows up on the ship of course both female crew members will fall in love with him nevery single shift in character interaction happens extremely suddenly which is only one of the many obvious clues to how much this film has been cut nthe most prominent example however may be the fact that when the film starts there are no opening credits nfurthermore the end of the film looks like they took what were originally intended to be the opening credits and spliced them in right before the real end credits nmaybe that why the film title is mentioned twice during the end credits right between james spader and robert forster nright after you get over the shock of not being told what movie you re seeing lest you decide to walk out upon making that discovery you might notice that the movie seems to have dropped you right in the middle of scene with little to no introduction to any of the characters or situations nthe rest of the movie feels like they skipped over the middle stuff in the character changes you know where they explain things and just went from point to point point danika is thoroughly enamored of yerzy and is ready to have his baby npoint tunney is now shagging troy and yerzy is unusually obsessed with the lava lamp thing ndoesn make sense nsince didn understand anything about these characters motivations did care when troy abruptly starts murdering them one by one and he does knocking off three of them in about 10 minutes nnot whit nit a shame because this cast contains lot of talented actors looking for something to do nthey don find it nbassett and spader say every line in the same monotone voice with the same blank expressions on their faces nsexual tension nmore like constipation nmaybe they re just embarrassed at having to utter such howlers as this thing was made by someone more powerful than god and whole lot less nice nnot that we ever find out who that is mind you nthe climax of their relationship taking place in transport pod is probably the film biggest forehead slapper nas troy peter facinelli inhabits the most obvious villain in history that no one ever suspected nhe awfully one note but it not as if he given any more notes to work with nthe rest of the cast does even less ntunney stands around looking cute then scared nphillips broods ncruz flirts with the computer nthen they all die and star blows up or something but really wasn paying much attention by then supernova is pretty awful but m cutting it little slack merely because expected less than what got nthat it nif you expect it to be good for whatever reasons you may have you ll probably hate it more than will neven the special effects are fairly unimpressive nothing you haven seen before and suffice to say the script isn going to save the film nhonestly though what do you expect from film with about dozen writers and director who had his name removed and replaced with pseudonym nit usually results in bad movie and that what supernova is ',\n",

powerful today even after the end of the cold war fail safe usa 1964 drama 111 minutes nscreenplay by walter bernstein based on the novel by eugene burdick and harvey wheeler produced by max youngstein directed by sidney lumet nreview by jamahl epsicokhan nthe most ironic aspect of nuclear war is that it doesn have winning side and losing side nin nuclear confrontation everybody loses and the aftereffects have devastating effects that impact the entire world assuming the world survives nthe idea and perhaps the only real option is to avoid war at all costs nthis is the theme of sidney lumet fail safe fictional drama based on the novel by eugene burdick and harvey wheeler fail safe takes place during the heart of the cold war the actual film was released two years after the cuban missile crisis when the united states and the soviet union were in static discord over an issue that can be summarized in single word communism nthe premise centers around combination of accidents and operation flaws nfive s bombers carrying nuclear warheads are ordered to set routine course for moscow after an unidentified aircraft is spotted heading toward america nthe unidentified aircraft turns out to be commercial airliner but mechanical failure strikes the military base that commands the bombers nsuddenly out of contact and with standing orders to remain on course until receiving new directives the bomber pilots cannot be recalled and they proceed to moscow with the intention of destroying it with nuclear strike na great deal of fail safe plot follows various characters as they attempt to devise ways of stopping the s bombers from reaching russia borders at any cost nthe plot is compelling and the story creates urgency and dread by painting the grimmest of worst case scenarios nthe reality sets in quickly as one attempt to turn the bombers after another fails ngeneral bogan frank overton taking orders directly from the president of the united states himself henry fonda is powerless the fate of the world lies in the hands of an automated pre programmed system that may not be stoppable simply because the creators of the war machines were too efficient in their task to make no win situation winnable nthe events in fail safe are fascinating because they re anything but predictable but the real reason fail safe works is because it understands more about nuclear war than what exists within the confines of its plot na key ingredient to the film is its ability to create an ongoing polemic about nuclear war communism the cold war and the united states role in all of it nmost of this is through the film use of the character groeteschele walter matthau an arrogant civilian theorist of nuclear weapons use who incidentally is on the president advising staff for analyzing the statistical plausibility of waging nuclear war nmany of the film most pointed messages arise from discussions where groeteschele is one of the key voices nearly in the film he hosts dinner party where he explains the importance of strategy in nuclear assault to minimize casualties what the difference between 60 million and 100 million dead na guest asks impatiently forty million groeteschele responds wryly nthe problem with groeteschele mindset is that he believes nuclear combat to be viable method of war nthe only difference to him between nuclear armageddon and conventional warfare is the raw data and the casualty totals ngroeteschele realizes that these weapons can destroy the world several times over nyet his answer to the arms race is not to slow down and try to cool the situation off as general black dan herlihy has often recommended non the contrary according to groeteschele that would lead to russia having more nuclear weapons than the s which would clearly put america at disadvantage nsuch stance was perhaps the central paradox and misguided practice of the arms race fail safe clearly sees it as one of the central issues of the cold war and likewise it becomes central theme in the film nwhy continue to build such machines of mass destruction while already possessing enough of them to destroy the world several times over nis it wise nis it even logical nno not really nalthough fail safe is more about the issue of nuclear weapons than it is about the political ramifications of communism there is scene in the film that deals with communism in an intentionally superficial one sided sort of way nagain this is achieved through groeteschele who is easily the film most important character in terms of the larger theme significance nin addition to providing the central pro nuclear war voice that the film warns against he also makes key remarks about communists that show just how much fear and resentment people of the period were prone to when it came to communism nthe context the film uses suggests that this hatred was often glib none of groeteschele logical trains of thought ventures so far into fantasy theoretical prediction that it merely absurd nhe labels the average marxist an unfeeling calculating machine that will do whatever it takes to preserve itself ngroeteschele takes it so far as to say that if the s drops the warhead on moscow the soviets will instantly surrender for to retaliate would invite counter measures that would further destroy russia home soil which must be preserved at all costs ngroeteschele seems to forget these people are human beings with emotions general black quickly reminds him that the soviets would attack out of revenge as any normal person would nthe irony here is groeteschele own mechanical theorizing nhe is so quick to judge the enemy that he doesn even realize his own seemingly programmed thought patterns nonce the film makes it evident that turning the s bombers will be impossible the question becomes what the consequences of destroying moscow will be njust how will the soviet union leader react and what can the president do to convey his best intentions just how does one pass off the deaths of millions of people as an mishap nwith the help of his translator buck larry hagman the president negotiates at length with the soviet leader in scenes that prove amazingly taut and powerful in their simplicity with lumet long takes of fonda and hagman in the same frame exchanging the dialog between the president and the soviet leader nwithout getting into too much detail will say that the compromise they ultimately reach is very costly yet necessary and as sensible as possible under the circumstances that is as sensible as nuclear incident can probably be nit does accomplish what it must it avoids an all out war something that simply isn possible because of its all too real consequences ndramatically the ending is quite powerful and the use of herlihy character as the symbolic matador providing bookend to the film by ending the story while tying into his dream sequence from the film opening is particularly appropriate fail safe is production of major hollywood studio released by columbia pictures and it has the structure of high tension suspense thriller that one might expect from hollywood film nnevertheless under lumet direction and walter bernstein intelligent adaptation of burdick and wheeler novel the film continues to have lasting effect even after the events on screen have unfolded nthe film often warns that the automation of war is something that may make nuclear holocaust an unintentional consequence of such mass arming nbut it was the conscious human choice to initialize this automatic arming that fail safe also finds dangerous nin retrospect the arms race seems to be one of the most puzzling exercises in futility of the century nit just fortunate that both sides were finally able to come to their senses and slow down rather than continuing groeteschele dangerous approach of speeding up and causing possible meltdown ',\n",

stranger dunne has also escaped the accident completely unscathed na comic book art dealer named elijah price samuel jackson who was born with degenerative bone disease that causes his bones to be so brittle that they break constantly has been seeking out someone like dunne his entire life nprice felt that there had to be someone exactly the opposite of him nsomeone whose bones would be so strong that they would never break nprice contacts dunne and convinces him to come down to his gallery for talk where he suggests that dunne could quite possibly be something akin to superhero from the comic books price used to read when he was child ndunne doesn believe him at first but price assists him in discovering his powers and helps him hone his craft until he discovers what his true calling really is nwriter director night shyamalan had tough act to follow with his sleeper hit the sixth sense nhow exactly does one follow up on one of the biggest and most popular thrillers in recent years nfor shyamalan the answer must have come as easy to him as nuclear physics does to kindergartners ndoes this new film measure up to his breakthrough box office smash though nthe answer to that question is not very easy one either nas far as pacing goes the sixth sense seemed almost interminable nit wasn until the surprise ending was revealed that realized the film was actually intentionally and perfectly paced in order to give the audience ample time to re connect all of the information they had seen once the climax had been reached nfor unbreakable shyamalan gave the film much more satisfying pace which in many ways blows away the film that had come before nthe story moves along at steady pace and shyamalan direction is excellent with the camera almost constantly moving nthere are tons of great shots in the film not least of which is conversation that opens the film between willis character and another train passenger nthe shot seems as though it were filmed like we were watching the two talk from between the train seats and the camera steadily glides back and forth between the two actors as they speak nalso very impressive is the film score by james newton howard who also scored shyamalan sixth sense and the similar film stir of echoes as well as this year dinosaur nseveral of the scenes are driven by very catchy beat and help to increase the tempo of the film none of the best examples of this is scene in which dunne goes into train station to exercise his powers nthe music in combination with the stellar visuals really go long way towards making this an incredible movie nif there was any one soundtrack would make must purchase this year this one would be it nthe film also boasts some great performances including precocious child actor trying to vie for the oscar throne left vacant by haley joel osment nwillis turns in great performance as the sad sack dunne who just can seem to figure out why he been depressed for the last few years nhis character almost seems pathetic when we first meet him but he eventually grows into his own under elijah tutelage njackson is one of the better actors of our time and here he turns in yet another great performance as the ever injured elijah nthough his hairstyle is absurd jackson seems to infuse such great deal of pain into his role that the mortar board hairdo can easily be overlooked nrobin wright penn role seems slightly underwritten but she still manages to get across the intense hurt of her character need for love from her husband and her desire to make things work again nspencer treat clark as the dunne young son jeremy shows that shyamalan still has knack for picking young actors and he turns in one of the most competent performances in the film nout of all the characters jeremy is perhaps the most emotional and clark does great job with the role nwhere the film does lose points though is during its surprise ending nshyamalan has said in interviews that he was going to do an ending that blew away the one presented by the sixth sense but found myself saying that was it nwhen unbreakable revealed its own ending nit not that the ending is bad it just that the ending doesn quite have the emotional punch that the other film did nplus it almost seems like it sets itself up for sequels and won reveal the ending here but you ll understand what mean when you see it nessentially what all of this means is that shyamalan has made another good film with unbreakable nthe only real problem is that the ending doesn quite fill the shadow left by its predecessor nas long as it isn held to the standard that sixth sense set which it ultimately will be it should be remarkably well liked film none thing seems clear though nshyamalan definitely has an affinity for comic books that he would like to share with the world and many comic book fans will also delight the vision he presents in this film ',\n",

pretty tough but something we all have to accomplish nsecondly and along the same line we can prejudge film because of it stars director etc the difference nwell in the first one we go into film thinking it going to be dumb or it going to be good and that would affect our viewing that movie sounds and looks dumb so m not expecting much non the second hand we re simply assuming it will be bad or good because of personal grudge against the film company it made by disney noh it just merchandising ploy then the actors jim carrey in it nit gonna stink or the director who ncan be that good nthis is more of biased viewpoint as opposed to first impression viewpoint nmake sense nok but what about comparing nisn that kind of along the same lines nwhen we compare certain actor or director or even composer credibility in one film to another they were involved in is that really fair nsure in sequels you can expect and accept comparisons lot more but what about jackie brown for example nis it fair for me to take the review and turn it into comparison of pulp fiction just because quentin tarantino directed and wrote the screenplay for both ni think it is and ll tell you why na good critic should be able to view the film from the average joe or jane viewpoint while still taking into account the artistic integrity behind the film nsometimes that can be tough the acting was superb but was bored or loved it nit was sooooo cheezy nmight be used to describe film nthese are contradictions and critic has to weigh both sides and come to suitable balanced critique nbut which is more important nand which is better nan extremely well shot and acted film that is boring or really amateurish film that you wanna go back to again and again ngetting back to the point my philosophy on comparing films being fair works because we re reflecting what the public wants to know anyway nevery average person out there who interested in this film is likely to ask how does it compare to pulp fiction nand so as critic m already responsible to ask that same question njackie brown stars pam grier the blaxploitation heroine from the 1970 who is likely to make big comeback thanks to her role as the title character ntarantino pulp fiction is in big part responsible for john travolta sudden revival in the movie industry and with talks of an oscar nomination the same is likely to happen for grier we ve made it thru comparison 1 jackie is 44 year old airline stewardess who brings in extra cash and probably her main revenue by smuggling large sums of money into the united states for ordell robbie pulp fiction samuel jackson and comparison 2 nordell is in the illegal firearms business and has enlisted the aid of louis gara robert de niro bank robber who just got out of prison after serving four years to help him accomplish scheme worth half million dollars ntrouble arises when jackie is stopped by atf agent ray nicolet michael keaton and taken into custody for possession of narcotics as well as having more money than is allowed in an airport without being claimed nnaturally this proves an obstacle to ordell plans and not as friendly intended as we hope he posts jackie bail after she is put behind bars nthe thing is ordell is in this for no one more than himself and as we learn from his previous actions he willing to kill anyone who stands in the way njackie finds herself in tight squeeze nordell won think twice about taking her out if she fails to help him as she always done yet at the same time compromise with the authorities would be in order if evidence against ordell was provided nit comes down to simple question would jackie rather face ordell or prison nwhat ensues is rich and intriguing example of storytelling as we question who jackie is really out to help the law ordell or maybe just herself ncoming into play is another 70 veteran robert forster as jackie bail bondsmen max cherry nmax obvious fondness for jackie will become major benefactor in her fight to beat both sides of the system and forster plays him with subtle charm that adds depth to unbrewed romance nalso involved is ordell surfer girl girlfriend melanie bridget fonda ditzy sun bleached babe who spends her time watching tv with bong in hand nfonda does the best she can with an essentially thin role but there nothing more to her and therefore she becomes tossable addition to an otherwise flourishing bouquet of characters nde niro is also wasted in his role as quiet nobody crook out to score few bucks for himself nde niro is brilliant actor but character who hardly ever speaks doesn need de niro to play him ncompared to pulp fiction comparison 3 the characters in jackie brown and very thin and replaceable nin pulp fiction even the small seemingly irrelevant characters were wonderful complete and lifelike whereas jackie brown has such common figures that it wouldn have suffered much with lesser talented cast the exception being grier ntarantino wrote this script with grier specifically in mind so to say that she is made for this role is reversed truth nsadly grier too could have received bit more attention especially when the story is all about her newly jarred perception of life njackson teams up with tarantino again but the chemical reaction isn as awesome as the first time njules was the rambling bible quoting hitman in pulp fiction and jackson is the only person who could have pulled it off nand although jackson is really really good in jackie brown don think he quite as irreplaceable nin fact maybe new face would have been better njackson could ve remained tarantino jules and new guy could have become ordell forever to remain so in our memories nsadly these characters are too much the same except ordell just isn as impressive and putting this in the hands of jackson once again is only going to deter from our fond recollections of jules nanother problem is that ordell is way too focused on in the beginning nthis is grier film so why spend so long getting to know man who will become more of supporting character as the film progresses nit not only makes the movie feel little too slanted but it makes for slow beginning because we have to take longer getting to the meat of the story nit is likely that those pouring into the theater to see this film are going to be those anxious to partake of tarantino quirky dialogue and eccentric directing style and not so much those interested in seeing silver screen adaption of elmore leonard novel rum punch nfor those movie goers don expect another pulp fiction and you ll be satisfied for the script oozes with the familiar brash qualities that has made tarantino an icon of 90 film making nthe directing has toned down bit however yet we re still reminded that this is tarantino movie thanks to odd split screen story telling devices and scenes being replayed multiple times from different viewpoints nso getting back to the question that began with this isn pulp fiction at all nit good but it isn anything that made pulp fiction such revolutionary effort in the first place nthis is more conservative tarantino but not one that won satiate true fans nif you can realize that this isn going to knock your socks off then you ll be happy to at least let it massage your feet nafter all we all know how much tarantino loves that particular part of the human anatomy

number of 80s films that haven seen don feel qualified to make such judgment but ll say this without hesitation raging bull is great motion picture and would be surprised if more than handful of films released between january 1 1980 and december 31 1989 come close to its level nbio pics often fall into one of two categories overblown hero worship or dry dull textbook account nit rare that movie with the moniker based on the life of comes across as anything more than sporadically energetic and marginally entertaining nraging bull is the perfect counterexample and brilliant argument for film makers to continue to work in this genre nthe picture takes the life of boxer jake la motta middleweight icon from the 40s and 50s and develops one of the most compelling character studies ever to reach the big screen nfor all 129 minutes director martin scorsese and actor robert de niro in the title role have us mesmerized by this individual who is by turns sympathetic sad and horrifying nhistorically raging bull is said to be mostly accurately with the lion share of the details culled from la motta own autobiography which was co written with joseph carter and peter savage nhowever although la motta is credited as the movie consultant he was reportedly unhappy with the final result because it portrays him as nothing short of an uncouth insensitive lout nthe la motta of the movie is man of extreme appetites who is driven by base bestial impulses paranoia jealousy and blind rage nsex and violence are inextricably linked nthe title is apt la motta is raging bull nin the ring he is terror not just beating his opponents but destroying them noutside of it he is no less vicious or more easily controlled nthe two people who spar with him on life canvas are his wife vicki cathy moriarty and his brother manager joey joe pesci nthese are the two who mean the most to jake and who as result of his inability to trust himself or others he loses nhe beats vicki mercilessly because he suspects her of infidelity and when he inaccurately believes that his brother betrayed him his lets loose with an explosion of violence nraging bull opens in 1941 when la motta an up and coming fighter is battling his way into the upper echelon of the middleweight class nover the years he wins several key bouts including one against his arch rival sugar ray robinson johnny barnes but his unwillingness to capitulate with the local godfather keeps him from an opportunity to participate in championship match nmeanwhile away from the ring la motta falls in love with 15 year old vicki who he marries after discarding his shrewish first wife nvicki becomes jake greatest prize wife in his view is not companion but possession and the source of his most extreme pain nhis own insecurity is so great that he cannot accept that woman as beautiful as vicki could be faithful to him nhence he is constantly haunted by belief that she is sleeping with someone else perhaps even his brother this leads to the famous line parodied in waiting for guffman and elsewhere are you king my wife nin the late 40s la motta gets his first shot at championship fight but with one huge condition he must take fall nhe does it so badly that an investigation is launched and he is almost thrown out of boxing ntwo years later he wins the championship only to lose it in subsequent bout to sugar ray nby the late 50s and early 60s when the film ends jake has become pathetic figure broke overweight loser who has spent time in jail for corrupting the morals of minor has lost his wife and children and is trying to earn few bucks by doing cheap standup routine nraging bull is the other side of rocky nsylvester stallone tale of boxing triumph was released to great critical acclaim in 1976 nit won the 1977 best picture oscar and sequel arrived in theaters before raging bull went into production nbut where rocky romanticizes boxing raging bull takes cold unflinching look at the violence both inside and outside of the ring nwhile scorsese primary aim is to present riveting deconstruction of la motta the man he never backs away from showing the seedy ugly underside of sport where gambling greed and organized crime force fighters to throw matches to continue working nrocky shows boxing at its noblest raging bull shows it at its most diseased nthere little can say here that hasn already said about de niro performance nin career that has included many fine roles this is his most outstanding nthe level of intensity de niro brings to la motta is unwavering nand although there a lot of travis bickle de niro character in taxi driver in la motta scorsese and de niro go to great lengths to make sure that if we never fully sympathize with him at least we understand the forces that drive him nthis is complete characterization and perfect example of acting nas the younger jake de niro is trim and fit nas the fat older man de niro gained 50 pounds and turned his body into grotesque parody of its normal form nhow many actors would go that far nthe best oscar statue is only one testimony to the lasting power of the performance ncathy moriarty and joe pesci both earned nominations for their supporting work although neither won ntheir portrayals have the same raw energy that infuses de niro npesci who has basically re created the same personality in two other scorsese films goodfellas and casino presents joey as slightly more intelligent version of his brother nthe misogyny and violence are still there only better concealed nbut when joey snaps as he does in one scene where he pounds on mobster frank vincent it startling to behold nmoriarty on the other hand must play the temptress with virginal qualities the only kind of woman who would ensnare jake nlater she called upon to portray the battered wife and mother whose love has turned into fear nscorsese and cinematographer michael chapman elected to shoot the bulk of raging bull in black and white few home movie segments are in color nthe choice is perfect for the movie giving raging bull unique look in an era when black and white approach is almost unheard of one important recent exception schindler list eschewed color for some of the same reasons that raging bull did nin black and white especially considering scorsese choice of shots and use of slow motion the violence is stark and disturbing nthere no room for romanticism in the ring with inky black blood staining the canvas nduring fight sequences the director also uses number of point of view shots designed to show the world however briefly from la motta perspective nscorsese could have chosen to end the film with la motta loss to sugar ray where he surrendered his middleweight crown nafter that his career was all downhill nyet the director allows the film to run for thirty minutes after this pivotal moment stretching more than decade into la motta future nthe reason is obvious scorsese isn as interested in boxing as he is in the character nfollowing his retirement la motta is still as violent and volatile as ever but he has lost the arena in which he can legally unleash those tendencies nwe see the results of this beast let loose on society and how the consequences of his actions reduce him to parody of his former self nwho cannot feel surge of pity for la motta as he quietly recites marlon brando speech from on the waterfront i coulda been contenda nperhaps raging bull is indeed the best film of the 80s nand if not it certainly perilously close to the zenith ',\n",

              " 'know that funnest isn a word fun is noun and therefore cannot be conjugated like an adjective nbut that the word that came to me right after viewing chicken run nno wonder this is the kind of movie that reduces you to childish expressions like that was the funnest movie ve ever seen nso to hell with webster chicken run is one of the funnest movies ve seen in while ni can remember the last time ve seen anything funner nthe chickens at tweedy farm are up to something nliving in concentration camp like atmosphere they are led by one plucky hen called ginger voice of julia sawalha who continually comes up with plans for escape and always gets caught subsequently spending day after day in the coal box none night brash american rooster flies in over the fence calling himself rocky mel gibson famous flying rooster and circus performer nrocky promises to teach the chickens how to fly and the situation grows more desperate as the nefarious mrs tweedy miranda richardson decides to abandon the farm egg selling plan for pie selling plan nshe orders huge pie making machine cackling chickens go in pies come out nwhat sort of pies nchicken pies of course nco director nick park and his studio aardman animation produced three oscar winning short films creature comforts the wrong trousers and close shave nthe latter two were the second and third installments of trilogy starring the delightful team wallace gromit man and his dog famous for getting themselves into increasingly peculiar adventures npart of what made the wallace films brilliantly entertaining was park uncanny ability to make an old story seem new the wrong trousers for example pulled out lot of old hitchcockian suspense tricks and close shave owed great deal of inspiration to classic detective stories nbut in the hands of park and his team the stories felt fresh and inspired and not the least bit contrived nnow teaming with co director peter lord park has created similar creature in chicken run nthe plot is largely lifted from the great escape watch for quick reference to the ball bouncing scene with some spielberg inspired action sequences providing the excitement nthing is the film doesn feel like it been lifted from somewhere else chicken run feels fresh alive like nothing else ever done npart of it is the original idea who in the world came up with the idea to make prisoners of war movie starring chickens npark and lord milk the incongruity for all it worth the characters treat their situation as if it were dead serious and to them it is nbut they re chickens so it funny to us nanother thing that helps chicken run and most of park films succeed is the animators subtle way of giving nods to the very films they re cribbing nthere are references to the great escape obviously and stalag 17 nthe chase sequence inside the chicken grinder parodies both raiders of the lost ark and indiana jones and the temple of doom nthere even nod to the blues brothers if you can believe it and the filmmakers even get in little light hearted ribbing at the expense of their star voice actor taking couple of very subtle jabs at mel gibson nationality and film history nthe braveheart reference is hoot if you catch it nwhen you consider just how fine line resides between funny parody and redundant one chicken run is downright brilliant in its execution nconsider this since july of last year ve seen dozens upon dozens of blair witch project parodies on television on the radio and online nout of all those maybe one or two were amusing the rest tiresome nwhy nbecause once you got past the thought that they re parodying that 8216 blair witch movie most of the parodies had nothing to offer no insight no original idea no greater purpose nthey were only funny if you had seen the movie otherwise you got nothing nconversely chicken run doesn lean on its parodies the film references are never the sole focus of any scene nif you ve never seen indiana jones the chase sequence is still fun neven if you have no idea who mel gibson is rocky remains an interesting character npark lord and screenwriter karey kirkpatrick realize that an audience does not need parody shoved in their faces before it understood and as result chicken run is filled with visual and verbal jabs that are never too obvious but not quite vague either nenjoyment of this movie doesn require knowledge of film history but if you ve got it chicken run is that much richer nthe voice cast turns in uniformly lively performances and the characters they play are given so many subtle nuances that it hard not to fall in love with every one of them nginger is perfect spunky and opinionated but with soft heart that forbids her to leave her companions behind and julia sawalha known as the cute mousy girl on absolutely fabulous nails it nshe has warm human chemistry with gibson whose rocky hides his personal doubt under brash gung ho veneer nthe characters inevitable romance doesn feel contrived but sweet npoor mr tweedy tony haygarth suspects the chickens are organizing in some way but his limited intellect prevents him from figuring things out and his overbearing wife certainly isn any help njane horrocks delivers lovely voice characterization as tragically optimistic babs hen that runs away with most of the best one liners all while perpetually crocheting sweater and two supply trading rats that seem to have walked straight out of monty python sketch nearly steal the show during the lively central swing dancing sequence nthey even come up with an inspired riff on something that baffled scholars and theologians alike for decades the chicken vs egg dilemma none might have expected this inevitable joke to come off as wearisome but as with most of chicken run it comes as delightful surprise nthe film manages to cross all barriers it should be accessible to both children and adults brits and yanks rats and chickens nthe animation is first rate nremember that this was all done the old fashioned way with actual humans moving clay figurines around on tiny set bit by painstaking bit and you see just how truly remarkable chicken run really is nthis movie possesses that same quality that makes pixar studios animation great precise and unwavering attention to detail nas in such top notch family fare as bug life or toy story 2 chicken run has something to offer in nearly every frame ncertainly passive viewer can enjoy it as straightforward story with worthwhile moral and some surprisingly touching scenes but active attentive viewers will enjoy it even more because they ll catch all the details nanyway the movie just boatload of fun nfunnest damn movie ve seen all year ',\n",
              " 'jackie brown entered theaters with little fanfare and lot of expectation neven though advance publicity on this one was fairly limited the audiences waited for the showings with heightened anticipation nthis is after all the first movie quentin tarantino has directed since the highly touted pulp fiction nto say he has been inactive in between would be to tell falsehood since he has been involved in such projects as destiny turns on the radio desperado four rooms and from dusk til dawn nhe was also called in at the last minute to help punch up the screenplay for crimson tide i willing to wager the debate over which silver surfer is the only true silver surfer was penned by him ntarantino contributed on and off screen to these films but never took the director helm nnearly four years since gaining notoriety on the hollywood scene and making john travolta star once more tarantino returns with film he can call his own nthe film opens up with an homage to the graduate with jackie brown pam grier on one of those airport people movers as the credits are displayed in front of her njackie is flight attendant for air cabo which flies back and fourth between los angeles and cabo san lucas nthis makes jackie convenient cash courier for gun dealer ordell robbi samuel jackson who is currently keeping his money stashed in mexico nhowever while bringing fifty thousand dollars back into the s for ordell jackie is apprehended by fbi agent mark dargus michael bowen and atf agent ray nicolet michael keaton who catch her not only with the money but with bonus of couple of ounces of illicit drugs njackie didn know they were in the package with the cash but that of no consequence to the authorities who threaten jackie with couple of years hard time if convicted nof course dargus and nicolet are just using the sentence to get jackie to turn over the big fish ordell nordell uses honest bail bondsman max cherry robert forster to get jackie out of jail but while max is immediately attracted to her jackie is more concerned about her immediate safety since ordell killed the last one of his operatives who got picked up by the police nsure enough ordell shows up at jackie apartment that evening and tries to silence jackie for good but she borrows max pistol and manages to turn the tables on ordell ninstead of closing the irony circle and relocating bullet from the pistol chamber to ordell head jackie proposes deal nsince ordell wants to get his money out of mexico jackie will get back up to her old tricks and be courier for him once more but this time for more substantial fee fifteen percent of ordell half million dollars nwith gun in his face how can ordell not agree nby itself this premise might have been interesting enough to carry the film nhowever we are also introduced to number of double crosses which make us pay attention and think njackie claims to be bringing the money in for ordell but she also making deal with the feds as well as with max nthe film throws us off every once in while by leading us to believe the deal we thought was authentic is actually sham but it is in no way done to the extent that we feel jerked around ninstead it actually nice departure from the predictability which is prevalent in so many of today movies nat least this film has little imagination nmost of the performances in jackie brown are above par npam grier of whom had never taken notice before plays jackie with mix of confidence and vulnerability which makes her character believable nsamuel jackson has kind of mesmerizing quality about him as he handles himself in situations where you know he is in total control nrobert forster is thoroughly likable because he comes across as such an honest guy trying to do his best nnever mind that he belongs to profession where sneaking into guy apartment to zap him with stun gun is simply matter of course nhe just so down to earth the nature of his job really doesn occur to us even when we re shown him bringing handcuffed woman to prison or when we see the tools of his trade nin supporting roles are robert de niro as louis gara recently paroled friend of ordell and bridget fonda as melanie one of the girls ordell keeps around town nunfortunately de niro is basically wasted as his lines are few and far between and then they are mostly clipped sentences nin this film he not really de niro but stereotypical de niro uttering things like little bit and pretty much nfonda on the other hand plays the slightly spaced out melanie with satisfactory relish and cuteness such that even when she is annoying louis we are taking her side nas is characteristic of any film in which tarantino has had hand the dialog is quick and snappy nit grabs our attention and is actually interesting and in many respects this makes jackie brown film which needs few visuals the lines are form of art in and amongst themselves ndon count tarantino out when it comes to using the camera however nthere a scene where max is unwittingly watching dry run of money exchange and he not really sure what happening but by composing the scene just so his realization of what going on is felt simultaneously by the audience nwe look at the screen and think gee that clever and then think the same thing about how the film induced us into that wonderful feeling of catching on nalthough tarantino isn afraid to drag out shot for dramatic effect it unfortunately works to varying degrees in this film nthere are shots where character is simply driving and we watch this person and somehow get an idea of what is going on in his or her head nthis is tribute to both direction and acting nhowever there is at least one other scene where we follow jackie through mall and she is looking for something desperately looking for something nwe get the idea of the frantic nature of her search but we follow her for so long that we end up not really caring about what she looking for but instead hoping she ll just stop noverall viewing jackie brown is time spent well nsome flap has already been made about the language used in the film but it really not much worse than many of the other movies out there today nin fact one might even be able to say that the way in which these offensive words are employed almost cause them to parody themselves and therefore transcend their own offensiveness

              " 'people who enjoy science fiction are often faced with unpleasant surprises due to the improper labelling of novels stories comic books or movies noften science fiction aficionados find material previously labelled as science fiction to be pure fantasy or supernatural horror or rather simple techno thriller nin such cases mistakes are understandable genre boundaries are never clearly marked nbut believe there are really few cases when movie labelled as science fiction actually happens to be straight historical epic nsuch thing occurred in former yugoslavia some fifteen years ago when national distributors gave such treatment to the right stuff 1983 film directed by philip kaufman nthe mistake of the distributors could be explained with the fact that the official poster of the film features men in space suits nbut the right stuff film isn even fiction nit was based on the non fiction book by tom wolfe covering the early years of american space program nthe plot of the film begins in 1947 when few people heard of edwards air force base major test site for experimental planes nthe major aim of test flights is to determine ability of manned aircraft to reach 1 mach speed and thus break the sound barrier nmany pilots tried to achieve that goal and many paid with their lives for such bravado nbut one quiet pilot chuck eager played by sam shaped succeeds and thus gives example for whole new generation of test pilots determined to enter history books by breaking new speed records nten years later soviets have launched sputnik marking the beginning of the space age nin order to regain national prestige us government decides to be the first to send man into space nbest air force navy and marine pilots are recruited into program but not yeager because he lacks college education and desired all american image nin one of critics polls the right stuff was named as one among top 10 films made in 1980s nsuch high position could be explained with the fact that kaufman film looks quite atypical for its time nwith more than three hours of length and epic scope it looked more suitable for 1950s and 1960s age when hollywood used to make films larger than life nbut the real reason lies in the fact that it was made by truly remarkable and talented filmmaker nphilip kaufman created reputation in 1970s by using all the opportunities of that golden age in order to create original memorable movies nthe right stuff was the last of them swan song of an era when producers allowed directors to spend big bucks on unusual risk taking artsy projects nthe right stuff is unusual because it lacks many standard elements of hollywood film nthe plot is almost non existent and not very coherent the story featuring many interesting incidents and anecdotes shifts focus from the old generation of test pilots embodied in yeager to new generation of the astronauts nthe film also lacks conventional protagonist yeager who also appears in small cameo remains the true hero of the film but equal time and exposure is also given to other astronauts and their wives making this movie into ensemble piece nthat gave opportunity for kaufman to use multitude of great acting talents until that specialised only for bit or character roles nsam shepard is great as yeager war hero whose greatest achievement breech of the sound barrier remained obscured in history books probably due to his own modesty non the surface he lacks personality compared with his hyped and more fortunate astronaut colleagues but shepard gives texture to this character with subtle gestures and phrases nshepard performance is followed with great acting by ed harris as clean cut marine and future politician john glenn nyoung dennis quaid is more than fine as arrogant fighter jock gordo cooper and this arrogance is mirrored in his friend and most tragic figure of virgil grissom superbly played by fred ward nalways reliable character actor scott glenn provides some comic relief as navy aviator and arguably first american man in space alan shepard nkaufman left room for female talents to excel too barbara hershey pamela reed veronica cartwright and mary jo deschanel are great as pilots wives nroyal dano is also impressive as menacing figure of preacher but the most memorable performances belong to donald moffat as vice president lyndon johnson and jane dornacker as nurse murch ngreat acting talent assembled for this film was mirrored with kaufman superb direction nmost notable of all is the methods kaufman uses in order to suggest the passage of time nthe beginning of the film shows test pilots living in the middle of desert as virtual unknowns far away from strict rules and discipline neverything seems natural yeager can indulge himself in horse riding just few yards away from the fastest and most precious aircraft in the world nin that setting it quite normal for important technical problems to be solved with simple chainsaw and for the test pilots not to report their ribs being broken before most important flights nbut the times are changing ww2 alliance with ussr is replaced with cold war and natural pilots like yeager must be replaced with more disciplined conventional pilots ntheir entire lives become focus of media frenzy and their job is subjected to strict rules meticulous plans and they must fight the bureaucrats publicity seeking politicians and uncaring scientists like former nazi rocket expert werner von braun played by scott beach only to preserve their most basic human dignity nthis contrast is underlined with the beautifully edited sequence while yeager conducts his final and most spectacular test flight in absolute obscurity mercury astronauts receive fame and fortune although some of them even before going in the space nthose contrasts and similar effects are achieved with kaufman superb use of poetic movie language nediting is great and photography by caleb deschanel provides many memorable scenes like the funeral in the desert or astronauts in their suits walking in slow motion the same image would be copied in many latter films nalthough kaufman enjoyed support of nasa and american military which provided authentic locations and period equipment he still had to use special effects in order to simulate space flights nthose effects are excellent and they can still fool the audience accustomed to cgi and real footage of earth from outer space nanother fine contribution of this film is oscar awarded musical score by bill conti still tremble from excitement every time hear it nit is accompanied with the use of holst and debussy nsome of the songs used in the background also provide authentic atmosphere of the historical period nthis film is great and its cult status is well deserved but there are some minor flaws nsome of the mercury astronauts aren fleshed out enough although being played by fine actors like lance henriksen nfilm also lacks proper closure non the other hand most logical conclusion of the film landing on the moon would require this film to be more than six hours long nalso some critics were prone to attack this film as too amerocentric and hard on russians who were portrayed as evil monsters just in line with most virulent cold war rhetoric of reagan america nin some of contemporary interviews kaufman defended that approach by claiming that he wanted to make film as authentic as possible and in order to do that he portrayed russians not as they were in real life but as they were perceived by americans in early 1960s ntime has passed now we don see astronauts as heroes nin this age of widespread satellite communications and routine space missions those men and women in space suits are seen as mere maintenance workers nfew young boys want to be astronauts when they grow up nbut this film sentimental reminder of the times when future began perhaps could encourage at least some of them to follow mercury astronauts footsteps seek new frontiers in the sky nand even if they decide to stay on earth they could still appreciate the right stuff as an extraordinary piece of cinema ',\n",

              " 'it seemed like the perfect concept nwhat better for the farrelly brothers famous for writing and directing comedies with offensive subject matter than to make movie about guy with split personality nit exactly the sort of thing the brothers relish poking fun at something serious in this case mental illness throwing all care to the wind to get laugh njim carrey signed on too neven better nthe national alliance for the mentally ill even helped out by levying complaints against the brothers new film before its opening claiming it was misrepresenting the condition of split personality labeling it incorrectly as schizophrenia and so forth nsuch protest seemed like just the sort of thing that would of course only add more fuel to the farrelly brothers fire proving that some people just couldn take joke and that the farrellys would be helping the more enlightened viewers to yet another dose of their brilliantly subversive comedy nyes it all seemed perfect but one thing went wrong their movie isn funny nit not for lack of trying nthe farrellys utilize in me myself irene their most high concept premise ever carrey plays charlie baileygaites man who after being dumped by his wife for midget limo driver decides to bury all his aggressive feelings deep down inside and never release them nthis of course means all his neighbors exploit his entirely too forgiving nature making his job as rhode island state trooper increasingly difficult nsoon enough charlie repressed aggression manifests itself into second independent personality named hank deep voiced boorish ogre unafraid of taking the assertive actions his predecessor had been unable to muster nthis guy isn above crashing car through the wall of the barber shop in which he been insulted or holding little girl head underwater because she refused to stop jump roping in the street nthen things start getting lost in the most complicated plot the farrellys have ever attempted and the film runs off its tracks nsome have suggested that this isn a problem because the farrelly brothers brand of humor doesn require plot to work nthey re wrong of course plot was greatly instrumental in building up the kind of rollicking comic energy that infused the farrellys last effort 1996 there something about mary 1999 outside providence was technically an earlier project nthe brothers earlier film wasn funny merely because it contained outrageous gags despite what some newsmagazine articles would have you believe but rather because its most outrageous gags were entirely unexpected nin mary the farrellys managed several times to pull off neat sleight of hand trick they have you thinking the story was going one way then reveal its real direction in delightfully surprising fashion me myself irene by contrast seems to have been made by folks who looked at mary and saw only the surface grossness missing all of the subtle machinations that really made it work nhaving been produced by the same guys who made mary irene seems like an even bigger disappointment nthe brothers pile on the offensive humor taking shots at race midgets albinos mental illness and all manner of bathroom jokes nbut they haven come up with way to make any of it fresh most of me myself irene comes off as rote by the numbers adolescent comedy nthe plot with carrey forced to drive alleged fugitive irene waters renee zellweger who in more trouble than anyone knows back to new york has an ending that entirely predictable from the get go think charlie and irene will fall in love nyeah me too nthe farrellys then introduce scores of different characters and none of them ever manage to do anything you haven already expected them to do no matter how outrageous their actions might be ncompared to the curveballs the farrellys are used to throwing this stuff is almost entirely soft tossed presenting an obvious problem when gross out humor loses its shock value it no longer funny merely gross nthe jokes that do work are milked over and over until their effectiveness runs dry ntake for example the subplot involving charlie three black sons anthony anderson mongo brownlee jerod mixon nthe incongruity of it all is funny for while with three burly black men discussing higher math in ghetto language and white bread carrey mouthing said language with an entirely too pleasant smile on his face nbut by the end of the film they re still doing the same schitck it hasn been elevated to another funnier level and it hasn been dropped either nthat too bad because it ceases to be amusing about halfway through me myself irene reeks of wasted opportunities nthere ought to be more focus on how other people react to charlie new personality and on how charlie deals with the consequences of hank actions nthis doesn really happen nearly every supporting character learns about charlie condition early on so they don have any opportunity to be surprised by it nthe film throws what looks like patented farrelly curve in scene towards the midway point involving an albino companion charlie and irene pick up called appropriately whitey but the script doesn go anywhere with it instead leaving the thread twisting in the wind before awkwardly tying it up during the climax njim carrey is gifted comedian both physically and vocally but he left with nothing much to do here except contort himself in manner similar to steve martin in all of me nit a great showcase of flexibility and split second role shifting but none of it is terribly funny ncarrey doesn pull any stunts we don expect him to pull and the farrellys script doesn give him anything else to pull the situations in which he must perform the role shifting aren set up in any meaningful way nperhaps carrey can take solace in the fact that his supporting actors fare no better nzellweger irene is not strong female lead mary in mary may have been part adolescent fantasy but she was also intelligent and strong willed nirene is nothing in particular as the film never makes clear whether she ditzy clever or neither nas such she gives us nothing to latch onto as the only sane person in the film nchris cooper is stuck playing exactly one note as corrupt fbi agent and his character is entirely too straight laced for movie like this nhe like the others does absolutely nothing unexpected nafter viewing the shapeless mess that me myself irene eventually dissolved into was stuck wondering whether or not the farrellys had outsmarted themselves nmaybe their kind of comedy can only work for so long until audiences get wise to it and stop being shocked nbut don believe it good filmmakers find ways of surprising their audiences even after people have grown attuned to their style nif the farrellys are indeed good smart filmmakers and still think they are they ll rebound just fine neven after that happens though ll still consider me myself irene to be high caliber misfire ',\n",

              " 'rented brokedown palace last night blind having heard nothing about it beforehand and enjoyed it immensely despite some flaws nfor anyone wishing to have the same experience would suggest reserving judgement of the movie until viewing it in its entirety nthat is no easy task nsuperficially it bears an unfortunate and not necessarily unintended resemblance to several other movies notably return to paradise and midnight express nas result nearly every review of brokedown palace subsequently read became hopelessly entangled in making the obvious comparisons nthe consequence was nearly universal condemnation which is shame as this is fine film nfor those who have yet to view the movie let me say that it is not an attempt to portray the nightmarish reality of the third world criminal justice system as was midnight express nor completely the moral dilemma and examination of the meaning of friendship and humanity that was the heart of return to paradise nin my view if this film is to be compared to any other source it would have to be joseph conrad acclaimed novel lord jim nproblematically the basic storyline seems more than familiar two american teenage girls on vacation are sentenced to spend most of their lives in thai prison for drug smuggling in an obvious set up involving suave con man shadowy criminal conspiracy and corrupt third world justice system nthe girls are alice claire danes and darlene kate beckinsale nthey re life long buddies who planned high school graduation trip to hawaii and then secretly changed their destination to the more exotic thailand without telling their parents nonce there they find 6 hotel and go sight seeing which includes sneaking into luxury hotel to sip expensive drinks poolside nthey get caught trying to charge the bill to the wrong room minor transgression which will later come back to haunt them but they are saved from hotel security by charming friendly australian nick daniel lapaine who takes care of the bill with more polished execution of the girl scam nhe then proceeds to separate the girls and make smooth moves first toward alice then toward darlene nby now alarm bells are going off among viewers nthe ever present nick is too slick and his stories don add up to us the girls of course are too naive to notice nlong before it happens we re anticipating the inevitable disappearance of the fast talking smuggler and the arrest of our teenaged sitting ducks at the airport en route to hong kong caught holding the bag literally containing heroin njust as predictably the thai police and courts do their part in meting out injustice and our trusting tourists are prison bound for long stretch nleft unanswered is the red herring issue of whether one or the other of the girls was willing accomplice nfor those in need of ready answer might suggest closer scrutiny of the bell hop at the girl fleabag hotel nas one door after another to their comfortable former life is closed the girls and their families turn in desperation to the noiresque expatriate lawyer fixer yankee hank bill pullam and his thai born partner wife na recurring element of the movie is the tension between appearance and reality as expressed in one of the film tag lines who do you trust and hank is no exception although seasoned movie goers and those familiar with pullman oeuvre will find few surprises nmuch of the remainder of the movie is smorgasbord of intriguing themes incompletely explored in short hand fashion nlou diamond phillips for instance plays delightfully sinister and callous dea agent who while appearing to be casually accommodating to hank withholds vital information at crucial moments nis he part of wider conspiracy nwith an inherently powerful if somewhat tired premise the film offers by parts riveting courtroom drama prison story and potential character study of american teens their relationship and what constitutes friendship between them nthe result is reasonably engaging and suspenseful with the girls interaction hank investigation and the various trials and hearings offering hope for their release delivering tension as does the foredoomed possibility of their escape nif brokedown palace has major flaw it is its creators tendency like time constrained tourists to take frequent side trips down fascinating alleys only to reverse direction half way down and return to the story main avenue nand if that were all there was to brokedown palace it wouldn be very good movie nbut believe the writers and director were after bigger game and in this they succeeded nfor the main theme of the movie like the proffered name of its location is freedom in all its permutations nultimately the other sub themes may be considered window dressing nyoung and pretty alice danes is an old soul wild streetwise teenager with thirst for freedom and adventure npresented as perfect blend of yin and yang dark and light is her cautious best friend darlene beckinsale nclear eyed and straightforward alice is more complex than her friend nshe comes from poorer background has reputation for getting into trouble and has lost the trust of everyone including her own father nwhereas darlene life is on track aimed at college marriage kids career suburban home middle age and fulfillment alice is uncertain unfocused and yearning none poignant scene in the film shows darlene shouting across an open moat to visitors friends and relatives from home whose lives continue while hers is in limbo ntellingly alice is present but not included njust as revealing of their different personalities when alice and dar first come to thailand the openness and delight on alice face doesn read as simple naivet the way she stands up and stretches as she and her friend ride along in small boat reaching toward the sun she really is drinking in what she believes to be freedom while dar remains seated in the shade brokedown palace begins with an admission by alice of her guilt in tape recording sent to hank nhowever unintentional it all alice fault nshe responsible for persuading her friend to lie to her parents to sneak away from the safety of hawaii to the perils of thailand to try the petty scam which places them in the clutches of the evil nick in case one misses this point in the inevitable confusion of film beginning darlene obligingly reminds alice of her culpability in prison ndar of course is the willing dupe which in her view confers innocence nnever mind that it was her coercion of reluctant alice to accompany her to hong kong which placed them in police custody in the first place or that her naive confession sealed their fate ndar is innocent nit doesn matter nalice is the subject of this movie nshe and her journey toward personal freedom nalong the way we are treated to an unsympathetic portrait of the shallow american culture which created these girls with their half baked sensibilities and materialistic goals nin the end that culture like its representatives yankee hank and dar father man who knows how to grease the wheels proves as impotent as its government in the face of the girl tragedy nthailand culture contrary to most opinion comes off much better by comparison nit amazes me that reviewers argued this point at both extremes ni believe the filmmaker view was that thai culture is vastly different from the american but not necessarily inferior nthe thai with the sole exceptions of corrupt official and spiteful prison spy were uniformly consistent in their behavior and true to their principles nthe girls were shown to be treated no better but certainly no worse than the native born ntheir prison in stark contrast to the probable reality was no hellhole being relatively clean and sunlit nthe prison authorities demanded good hygiene provided medical care when needed and hard manual labor consisted of picking grass nthe thai guards were authoritarian what else but certainly not routinely sadistic nas for the thai justice system the reasoning of the thai judges during both an appeal hearing and in the film penultimate scene was devastating in its logic and morality freedom has many faces and brokedown palace explores many of them nin the extreme we have freedom of the body and freedom of the spirit nsome settle for the former alone while others remain imprisoned with an entire nation to roam without the latter nbut freedom seldom comes without price nwhich is why the movie other tag lines are what is your dream nand how far would you go ni believe could make good case for the interpretation that the person who attains freedom incarcerated or not by film end is alice nshe finds redemption and salvation through the acceptance of personal responsibility ni think the light bathing only her figure among the assembled prisoners in the final scene visually signals that fact nkate beckinsale character might more properly be likened to the released temple bird referred to twice during the film trained to fly back to its cage nas the thai magistrate observed in the film climactic scene the issue was always one of character and the jamaican prisoner made it clear that freedom is achieved within oneself nif one thinks back over the movie which character was transformed by their experiences nincreasingly the cinema landscape seems to have become littered with endless permutations of kung fu woman female characters virtually indistinguishable from male action figures nhere at last is the story of modern heroine nin reading the many user comments was struck by what seems an unusual phenomenon whether or not person liked the movie almost everyone praised the actors nthink about that nwhen was the last time you came away from motion picture possibly hating it but raving about all the performances in it ndo yourself favor rent brokedown palace and watch it with open mind nthere more there than meets the eye ',\n",

              " 'written by alex cox tod davies terry gilliam and tony grisoni ndirected by terry gilliam ni ve always preferred mushrooms to blotter acid ndropping acid is like riding roller coaster blindfolded you have no idea where the peaks and valleys are no idea when the next terrifying decent will send your stomach into your throat and no idea how long the ride will last nthen there the hard knot in your gut and the clenched teeth that come with ingesting strychnine laced dose nmushrooms on the other hand offer the psychedelic equivalent of leisurely ride on ferris wheel steady reassuring assent short period of thrilling motion and color and then smooth landing nacid is for daredevils mushrooms are for refined seekers of joy nmy point is that in fear and loathing in las vegas director terry gilliam has made an acid movie when wish he would have made mushroom movie nfull of shocking sight gags aggressive images and grotesque comic performances the film certainly offers something for those fans of hunter thompson book who want to experience its twisted pharmacological world view from the inside out nbut for those of us who just want to enjoy well made film gilliam has produced mixed bag nfear and loathing tells the ostensibly true story of how self professed gonzo journalist hunter thompson johnny depp and hispanic activist attorney oscar zeta actosta benicio del toro came to las vegas to cover motorcycle race and found themselves trapped in the middle of district attorney convention while ingesting every conceivable drug available to man of means in 1971 noperating under the pseudonyms of raoul duke and dr ngonzo the two men careen into vegas on an acid and mescaline bender then hole up in hotel suite to binge on amyl nitrite cocaine tequila and rainbow of multi colored uppers and downers nthey terrorize every one they meet mostly because every one they meet terrifies them nduke hallucinates giant bats on the way into town then is attacked by horrifying lizards in the casino lounge ndr gonzo becomes enamored of thick bladed hunting knife and begs duke to throw the tape player into the bathtub with him just as jefferson airplane white rabbit reaches its climax nand these guys don just trash hotel rooms they rape them humiliate them and leave them for dead nthat neither of them ends up dead or in jail is testament to blind luck or providence depending on your point of view nthompson book besides being hilarious read has stood the test of time as an important historical document nit simultaneously exposed the 60 drug culture for the sham that it was and exposed las vegas as the place where the american dream came to die npontificate all you want about how the film illustrates thompson message but the truth is that stripped to its bare essentials what gilliam has wrought is drug comedy nit a cheech and chong movie nyou re there to watch depp and del toro ingest lot of chemicals and then laugh at the results see johnny take drugs see johnny fall down nthere nothing wrong with this concept but gilliam tries too hard nthis is frantic movie all sweaty close ups wide angle lenses dutch tilts and other worldly lighting schemes nthere are times when gilliam really does put convincing representation of an acid trip on the screen nbut to what end nmuch of the dialogue comes verbatim from thompson book and there are some priceless comic observations nbut you re hard pressed to hear or digest them amidst all the jumbled camera work nthis brings us to the performances which strike me as all wrong ndepp plays thompson as groucho marks filtered through george scott in patton gimmicky performance which works against the biting satire of thompson dialogue nin between his several puking scenes del toro fares better as dr gonzo but he also mumbles and sputters so many of his lines that their weight is lost nwatching these two made me wish that the movie had been made twenty years ago with dan akroyd and john belushi as the leads now that would have been something to see nit interesting to note that alex cox credited as co writer on the screenplay was originally slated to direct before gilliam took over nas much of fan as am of gilliam work cox would have been the better choice nsid and nancy cox best work covered essentially the same subject matter but cox was able to pull back and allow the characters of sid vicious and nancy spungen to carry the film ngilliam commits the compound sin of over directing his film while being uncertain of his purpose nwhat kind of movie was he trying to make anyway nit doesn try to be cautionary tale and it doesn work as broad comedy nif he had considered more carefully his purpose the result would have been much more interesting film nbut don want to be too hard on it nthere are some truly funny moments and if you re in good enough mood you might get kick out of it ni do however recommend watching fear and loathing in las vegas under the influence of your favorite controlled substance guarantee it will enhance the effect ',\n",

out hope she gets killed now nat that point it hit me didn care for any of the characters being played by actors didn really like nwhen the sole reason you care about character being played by sidney poitier in suspense film is because he being played by sidney poitier you know something rotten in the state of denmark nevery year couple films like this are released nyou know the cheap action packed international espionnage film featuring semi promising premise some big name actors usually bruce willis and the hopes that some audience members will forget the cold war ended several years ago nthis was the third one of 97 following the very lackluster the saint which featured an amoral costume changing bond wannabe and the surprisingly fun the peacemaker featuring clooney and kidman trying to stop an almost untraceable villain the jackal tries to mix both elements nand you thought the saint was bad the jackal is loosely very loosely hope based on the 1973 fred zimmerman classic that ve yet to see the day of the jackal which featured apparently suave hitman called the jackal played by edward fox trying to assasinate charles degaule nwell welcome to the 90s where sorta suave hitman also called the jackal bruce willis trying to kill the head of the fbi or nis he nafter being hired by russian mob lord as bit of vengeance for the murder of his brother killed in the opening scenes the jackal romps all over the northen hemisphere from helsinki to virginia setting up an elaborate scheme wherein he ll be able to assasinate this person and still get away to live in seclusion

brad pitt for worst fake irish accent of 97 who in massachusetts jail but who has apparently seen the jackal who has been eluding the law forever nsoon he out working with the two untrusting agents and trying to help them catch him nthere are numerous problems with the film and which one is the biggest one is pretty impossible to put finger on nthe film is supposed to be big suspense thriller but save couple moments the film never achieves suspense or even sense of intrigue nsure the big assasination attempt is bit cool looking and even slightly tense but every other scene in the film is too short and too dull to register nthe film never picks up enough to become thrilling experience or even an entertaining one nit doesn help that the plot is designed to be complex but falls into so many problems like plot holes and unbelievable circumstances nthe script of the jackal is complete mess mostly because it can decide what it wants to focus on nis this film about man trying to find redemption by catching nasty killer nis it film about nasty amoral hitman who in everything for the money nor is it combination of both the jackal aims for the latter but never focuses in on either character nthe connection between the two feels completely edited so much that in scene when the jackal turns around and notices declan you wonder how he recognized him so fast nthe worst part is the little past they try to give declan most notably his relationship with an old girlfriend isabella mathilda may given so little screen time that you almost forget her character exists until she pops up every now and then nthe supporting characters are worse nsidney poitier is given completely unplayable role that of man who is just stern sometimes and other times more giving and likable nwhat is poitier doing here nhe one of the best living actors ndoes he really need to waste his time doing drivel like this ndiane venora russian character is almost as bad with cigarette perpetually in her mouth and plastered on expressionless facade nit not that anyone bad here it that they have nothing to do nthe plot is joke feeling like it was pasted together by someone in post production who dropped each scene on the floor and pasted them together quickly so it could be released on time nthe jackal himself is not even much of an international villain nthere are several times where he in tight situation and makes things worse for himself the only explanation being that the filmmakers wanted to toss in cheap thrill ntake scene where he being followed by some agents into parking garage he quickly sprays his car another color and adds solvent that if touched kills the person who touched it ndoesn killing someone attract more attention than it does distract nand does he think dying his hair bottle blond makes him fit in in public place ngeez nis there anything good here nwell ncouple things ni did like willis icy expressions he may not have been real suave or anything but some of his looks are worth chuckle nrichard gere has couple of good moments making his character as likable as he possibly could have nand couple sequences are kicky in that kind of proposterous completely inane but fun kinda way most notably sequence where he tests out new gun on an annoying gun builder jack black and bit where he seduces gay washington man which has its share of couple good jokes most particular kiss by willis nbut none of these elevate the film any higher than it could go they re just little distractions along the way to amuse us mildly then toss us back into the world of dullness and stupidity that is the jackal ndirector michael caton jones who directed the far superior rob roy has made film that is made very couple months one that is unentertaining unintriguing and pretty much cold but will nevertheless make money because hey the trailers do make it look like it may be fun in that kind of retro clancy kinda way nevery now and then the filmmakers get it right

              " 'the most common and in many cases the only complaint against francis ford coppola 1972 masterpiece the godfather is glamorising of mafia which is presented as an institution guided by ancient tradition and virtues like honour loyalty and solidarity more suitable for some gentler kinder ages nmartin scorsese another italoamerican moviemaker confronted that perspective with his own more down to earth vision of mafia in 1973 mean streets movie that dealt with lower echelons of organised crime nunfortunately for scorsese his film was unspectacular and too artsy to compete with coppola influence on mafia portrayals in the movies nseventeen years later scorsese returned to mean streets of new york with another film that dealt with darker side of american organised crime nthis film was goodfellas epic black comedy which is today considered as one of the best and most influential films of 1990s ngoodfellas owes some of its initial success and popularity to the fact that it was based on the true story told in best seller book wiseguy by nicholas pileggi who would co write the screenplay for the film nthe book as well as the film chronicled thirty years in the life of henry hill played by ray liotta irish italian criminal from new york nat the age of 13 he gets recruited in the criminal organisation of paulie cicero played by paul sorvino local mob boss and gradually climbs up the ladder starting with small errands nafter couple of years together with his best childhood friend tommy de vito played by joe pesci he joins the crew of expert thieves led by jimmy conway played by robert de niro nthree of them spend years as best friends and associates gathering enormous wealth from their criminal enterprises that would culminate with one of the most spectacular robberies in american history nwealth influence and privileges of men connected with mafia are enough for henry hill to seduce his future wife karen played by lorraine bracco who would afterwards remain loyal to her husband despite infidelities domestic abuse arrests and would even be accomplice to his own private drug dealing business nbut the perfect world of wiseguys gradually begins to fall apart tommy unpredictable outbursts of homicidal violence jimmy reluctance to share his part of the loot with partners and finally henry own drug habit would lead to his downfall and make him question his loyalty to the friends ngoodfellas is an excellent example of film that represents work of film genius in his full glory nscorsese managed to create vision which is effective and complete despite being full of contradictions that would ripped the film apart in the hands of less talented filmmaker nworld depicted in this film is both ordinary and fascinating nscorsese spares no effort to show us all the violence hypocrisy and inherent paranoia of organised crime yet it manages to make it both seductive and funny nafter being exposed to two and half hours of the film and three decades of criminal history based on some notorious real life events the audience understands why the characters chose such dangerous life paths trading the superficial and short lasting glamour and prosperity of criminal to the dullness and poverty of honest citizens nscorsese also manages to break viewer moralistic inhibitions by showing truly revolting material scenes that depict personal tragedies broken homes human depravity violence bloodshed and murder in all their uncompromising reality but in manner that would make it amusing and funny to the audience nwith the use of ironic soundtrack manipulative shots character dialogue or narrator commentary goodfellas represents the new standards of black humour that would became very popular few years later during tarantino era neven if we don pay attention to skills with which potentially disturbing material becomes eye pleasing and entertaining we should admit that scorsese displays his talents of truly original and creative filmmaker nfirst we might notice unusual structure of the plot relatively minor subplot is used as movie ironic prologue nthen instead of single narrator scorsese switches to the second character as narrator in the middle of the film only to switch back to the original shortly afterwards nthis multiple points of views both in terms of narration and various subjective shots only lengthens the ironic distance towards characters and their situation nsame ironic distance comes with extremely effective choice of soundtrack nnostalgia for good old times is illustrated with easy listening 1950s pop songs while depression paranoia and bad times find their expression in more neurotic rock songs of late 1960s and 1970s nbut the soundtrack is most effective when it is used as ironic comment almost pastoral easy listening tunes make strong and very ironic contrast to the scenes of violence and bloodshed nhowever thing most associated with this film is couple of continuos shots that feature characters moving through large rooms and interacting with dozens if not hundreds of people nsuch scenes although they require very great skill and patience during their shootings became very popular among other directors in 1990s nfragmentary character of the screenplay which doesn have straight plot and instead bases film on series of loosely connected vignettes gives another interesting opportunity for scorsese nhe uses this structure of film to experiment and most successful of such experiments is hilarious day in life segment near the end of the film nanother essential element of goodfellas is large but superb collection of great acting talents nthe most respectable among them is robert de niro but his character who happen to be most quiet and business like member of criminal trio gets overshadowed by two of his friends and colleagues njoe pesci deserved his oscar for supporting role of homicidal psychopath tommy and his lines including ad libs probably represent the most memorable element of the film nray liotta although equally talented perhaps doesn look as the best choice for narrator and nominal hero of the film nliotta henry hill looks somewhat too hollywoodised and glamorous among this bunch of low level street thugs nliotta on the other hand improves general impression by very realistic and menacing portrayal of drug addiction nlorraine bracco is on the other hand very effective and believable as karen hill wife who gradually descends into same moral cesspool as her husband npaul sorvino is also very effective as patriarch mafioso and among the supporting cast most memorable is chuck low as pestering small time gangster who unknowingly digs his own grave nas combination of clever sociological study black humour and innovative filmmaking goodfellas became something only the truly great films could do work of art and excellent popular entertainment in the same time nbecause of this achievement and also because of the great influence on future filmmakers this cinematic gem deserves its rightful place among the best films of 1990s ',\n",

              " 'melvin van peebles sweet sweetback baadasssss song was watershed moment in the history of american cinema and the black movement nit was released less than decade after the civil rights movement had begun and almost twenty years before the rodney king incident nits violent and highly sexualized revenge tale of macho black hustler fighting back against white oppression and winning was something that had never been seen on an american movie screen before nin style content and how it was conceived and produced sweet sweetback was cinematic revolution whether or not one agrees with its subject matter nvan peebles black american who first gained recognition by writing novels in france built sweet sweetback from the ground up almost entirely by himself nbecause no studio would dare fund such film he was forced to raise all the money himself nthe movie ended up costing about 500 000 part of which was put up by none other than bill cosby nvan peebles cut costs by hiring non union labor and taking on most of the film responsibilities himself nhe wrote the script scored the music edited and directed the film as well as starred in the central role nhe was also brilliant entrepreneur who always found way to make an extra buck nfor instance when the mppa slapped the film with dreaded rating van peebles not only threatened to bring lawsuit against jack valenti and the mpaa but he also developed little marketing scheme he coined the phrases rated by an all white jury which he put on the movie posters to help advertise the film nhe also printed the phrase on tee shirts which he had no problem selling nthe storyline in sweet sweetback is deceptively simple nit takes place in los angeles and van peebles stars as the title character tough male hustler of few words who grew up in brothel and makes money by doing what he does best having sex none day he agrees to go with couple of amiable white cops down to the station to make it look like they re bringing in suspects on politically charged case involving murder nhowever on the way to the station the cops arrest young black revolutionary named mu mu hubert scales who they proceed to beat viciously nacting out of complete impulse rather than political motivation sweetback fights back and beats the cops to the brink of death nthe rest of the film follows sweetback as he evades the cops on his way to eventual escape in mexico nalthough the repetition of watching sweetback run gets little old by the end of the film this plot allows van peebles camera to roam the darker side of a the ghettos alleys and back street whorehouses that other films had always overlooked nvan peebles entire point in making the movie was to secure on celluloid vision of the black experience in america that other filmmakers had ignored nat the beginning of sweet sweetback he offers this epigraph which is traditional prologue used in medieval times when messenger brought bad news sire these lines are not an homage to brutality that the artist has invented but hymn from the mouth of reality nvan peebles wanted to make sure that his vision was one of reality not of exaggeration nof course with today abundance of rap and hip hop music that sings the same ode to black inner city life as well as films by spike lee john singleton and the hughes brothers sweet sweetback doesn seem all that revolutionary nit is important to remember that this film must be viewed in the context and time period in which it was made nat that time sweet sweetback was so controversial that only two theaters in the entire united states would play it ndistributors were petrified of film that in van peebles words gave the black audience chance to see some of their own fantasies acted out about rising out of the mud and kicking ass nof course once it caught on it caught on big sweet sweetback is now considered to be the film that kicked off the blaxploitation era although van peebles disassociates sweetback from other movies like shaft 1972 and the mack 1973 because those were financed by big hollywood studios sweet sweetback is also the only film deemed mandatory viewing by the black panthers nhowever even if when viewed from an african american perspective sweet sweetback is certainly not without its controversies nwhen it was first released an article was published in ebony magazine denouncing the film while at the same time the black panthers used an entire newsletter to praise it nthere have been arguments that the victory for sweetback is really no victory at all beating cops and then running away to mexico is nothing to be proud of nothers have pointed out that sweetback has little to say throughout the film he has no political motivations and therefore the violence and havoc he wreaks is not rooted in fundamental beliefs but in personal and selfish motives nstill others point to the clich black potency that stereotypes sweetback as being good at nothing but having sex illustrated in scene where he gains the respect of white biker group by bringing their female leader to orgasm nnevertheless movie like sweet sweetback cannot be made without conflicting points of view nit is revolutionary movie not because it about one man defiance but because it put front and center black issues that had never been dealt with before nuntil that point american cinema was an almost exclusively white domain and with the exception of sidney poitier all black actors were relegated to specifically black roles that were important only in relation to whites nthe fact that sweet sweetback was movie by black about blacks was something new in the opening credits van peebles lists the starring actors as simply the black community nvan peebles tells an interesting story that goes long way toward defining the difference between sweet sweetback and all movies that had come before it nwhen the movie first opened he saw it in theater next to an older woman nnear the end of the film when sweetback is wounded by the police and stumbling through the southern california desert she kept saying to herself oh lord let him die ndon let them kill him nlet him die on his own nit was so ingrained in her mind that death was imminent for any african american in movie who rebelled against white authority that she couldn even conceive of the possibility that the film might end with his successful escape nand of course sweetback does escape and the screen fills with the message watch out na baad asssss nigger is coming back to collect some dues nbeyond the political aspects sweet sweetback is an entertaining picture which van peebles always intended it to be nhe squeezed every drop out of his limited budget and produced film that although dated now was technically fantastic at the time nhe shot in rough documentary like fashion while also utilizing almost every visual and aural trick his technology would allow him nhe makes good use of older techniques like split screens freeze frames reversed color schemes and overlapping images nthe only time the film ever looks bad is during the night sequences because van peebles simply did not have the needed equipment nwatching sweet sweetback more than twenty five years after its initial release one realizes that it still has bite narguments can be made that race relations in the united states have made quantum leaps since the early seventies but there are still problems that are reflected in this film nbut there is more to the film than its racial aspect nthe legacy of sweet sweetback baadasssss song is not only the plentiful amount of art and music told from the african american perspective but more importantly the work of every artist who has fought to fund and produce that which is important to him ',\n",

nit may be the first week of april in 1999 but so far this year we have been given movie aimed at the 25 and under market almost every single week varsity blues jawbreaker cruel intentions simply irresistible the rage carrie 2 and the mod squad ncoming april 9 are two more of this type never been kissed and go and on april 23 we ve got the teen satire election and the teen horror comedy idle hands njeesh nout of all of these moves however the one that is most similar to the latest incarnation 10 things hate about you is this past january mediocre ho hum she all that nalthough similar in plotting ok darn near identical 10 things hate about you modern day version of shakespeare the taming of the shrew she all that got its inspiration from pygmalion is an infinitely superior film in every department from the smart direction by first time feature director gil junger to the charming and well written screenplay by karen mccullah lutz and kirsten smith to the striking ensemble cast who give the best group of performances in teen comedy since 1985 the breakfast club nand to top it all off in the inevitable climax set at the prom at least we didn have to once again suffer through goofy inappropriate dance sequence who could forget or want to remember for that matter this ludicrous development in she all that nthe day wide eyed shy new student cameron james joseph gordon levitt starts school at seattle based padua high he is swept away at the sight of the beautiful and popular sophomore bianca stratford larisa oleynik nalthough he doesn know french he purposefully learns some of it just so he can tutor her but finds that her paranoid gynecologist father larry miller won allow her to date until her bitter unconventional older sister kat julia stiles senior decides to nkat of course has sworn off the likes of boys but cameron sets out to find someone that will be the perfect match for her which is exactly what he finds in the form of the rebellious patrick verona heath ledger ncomplicating matters cameron dorky friend michael david krumholtz decides to use wealthy jock joey andrew keegan who also has his sights set on bianca as pawn so that he will pay patrick to get kat to go out with him and then cameron hopes to steal bianca away from joey nas you can see 10 things hate about you includes huge number of characters some of which haven even mentioned such as kat shakespeare obsessed friend mandella susan may pratt and bianca materialistic comrade chastity gabrielle union nat short but well used running time of 98 minutes all of the characters are perfectly handled satisfyingly developed and for the most part are not treated as caricatures another flaw of she all that where the bad guys and gals ran around constantly saying you re vapor nsince could sympathize with the realistic depictions of the central characters and since many of the comedic and dramatic scenes were surprisingly effective got completely caught up in all of the relationships and was thoroughly entertained naside from good screenplay it the performances that can make or break movie and director junger has really hit the jackpot naside from joseph gordon levitt 3rd rock from the sun who gives his strongest performance to date here none of the actors are that well known but it is this aspect that brings particular freshness to the proceedings nas the main character of kat julia stiles last seen in the miniseries the 60s is marvelous and always believable and certainly has bright future ahead of her neven though it is her role that is initially the most difficult and hard edged it was easy to identify with kat way of thinking she is against the silly tradition of the prom and loves reading sylvia plath and completely admired her individuality nno one think could have portrayed her as perfectly as stiles does nheath ledger as the infamous bad boy of the town injects much life into patrick and has lot of chemistry with stiles none other actor of note is larisa oleynik who with the help of screenwriters lutz and smith is able to turn bianca into person with multi dimensions even though she is accurately self centered at the on set nin one truthful scene cameron angrily asks her if she has always been so selfish and bianca grudgingly realizes that yes she has none off beat element of the film and source of some hearty laughs is the way that the school staff act which is strikingly unformal nallison janney as the guidance counselor ms perky who is writing trashy harlequin romance novel is comic dynamite as is daryl chill mitchell as the english teacher who reads shakespeare to the class in rap and at one point sends kat to the office because for once she actually thinks one of his assignments is really good nalthough there are few cheap laughs that are thrown into the film near the beginning most of it actually works especially in the humorous and witty dialogue exchanges and quirks between the characters nin one very funny scene chastity asks know people can be overwhelmed and they can be underwhelmed but can people just be whelmed nat another point bianca and kat father stand out larry miller who is constantly terrified that his daughters are going to get pregnant only allows bianca to go to the prom on one occasion before she leaves she has to put on the heavy fat suit he has so she will get an idea of what it like to be pregnant 10 things hate about you once and for all proves that there is still life in the teen comedy genre and this movie is probably more reminiscent of the great john hughes than any other film of the 90s nit also helps that the movie has perfectly assembled soundtrack mixing indie rock with new wave 80s songs and with thank goodness no rap nby the film end it actually had me rooting for certain characters to get together and was also quite pleased with how everything was wrapped up especially in the final scenes involving kat and bianca kat and her father and flawlessly acted and moving sequence in which kat gets up to read the poem she has written for her english class this is where the title comes from nluckily doubt would be able to find ten things hate about 10 things hate about you but the positive aspects of the film far out number ten ',\n",
